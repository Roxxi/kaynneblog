Star craft 2 is amazingly clear. Despite the high quality graphics, it's easy to see what's going on in the screen, better than war3 IMHO.

The keybindings are mostly the same, so if you've played Starcraft you can get going really fast. 

Most if the units have analogous units as Starcraft, so the differences don't totally make it too hard. 

The buildings have useful abilitiyes and various modes, very similar to NEs in war3. The obelisque let's you buff your drones to temporIly collect more resources, and the gateway can warp into a warp gate that let's you instantly create a single unit anywhere in your psionic field on the map, even if it's across the map. 

Sadly, it had the same 3d mode as war3 where you can pan down, but you can only rotate around 180 :-/
