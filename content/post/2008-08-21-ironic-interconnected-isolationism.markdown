There are so many social networking sites. Facebook, myspace, linked in, yahoo groups, on and on... then there are all the sites where people exchange information about things: consumer reports, yelp, boorah, google... then there are all the sites where people talk about all their interests: web forums, wikipedia, wiki-how, user groups. Information information information. People people people. Who likes/knows about/has/wants/has been/wants to become/is going/has gone/has known/has discovered/dislikes/flames whom/this/that/there/him/her and so on!  Information overload, as if humanity was trying to collectively serialize every bit of information in their collective mind, to create the metaphysical human consciousness.

The meta physical human consciousness- a consciousness that is all things simultaneously. A consciousness with all thoughts, all beliefs, all possibilities, simultaneously.  While I could use this as a jumping board into how amazing that that's what the internet is, the metaphysical man-mind, I'll leave that for another night.  Instead, I'm wondering why do we as a generation, a people, a culture, try to serialize our brains in to a bastardization of language and audio-visual expression? Why do we work to export our very essence to the cloud?  What are we hoping for?

We want to seek out those who have new ideas that we have yet to have, but we were always destined for. Whose thoughts, sounds, words, images, and expressions provide even more insight to who we are as people.  _Their_ thoughts will help us find _our_ selves?  But don't we grow when we have thoughts we've never had before? What better source for those thoughts than others around us. That is, after all, the beauty of the internet. The ability to have free idea exchange.

But again, I digress.  I'm not concerned here with the collective conscious, nor the cultivation of one's being, rather, I seek the answer to the question, _why_ do we do it? Why do we post every bit of information we can? I find it hard to believe that we're consciously working towards the universal perfect mind, or that we're concerned with our own personal growth. No. Something more self-interesting must be at play.

Well, quite simply, it's intimacy.  We want connect with others. We simply want to find those whose beings resonate with our own. We're seeking a connection with another person or people; an intimacy.  And this great, this wonderous internet, which seems like the a paradise for one who seeks intimacy seems to satiate us poorly. _And why is that?_ Are we not pouring out our souls? Do we not twitter? Update our facebook status? Do we not share every picture we take through picasa, and digg every news article we care for?  How can we, given such a massive information sharing device, find ourselves feeling separated, isolated, hidden, invisible, miniscule, utterly alone; when all we really want, when we do all that we can to satiate our emotional hunger, social desire, our core foundational sense of security; to find that sense of intimacy... it seems unthinkable. With so many people out there, _how could you NOT find those people with whom you connect with?_

And there, in that simple statement lies the answer.  There are _so many_ people out there.  How can anyone spend the time to chase down and pursue one lead when so many others might be missed in that time?  How can you risk focusing on a few people when you never know who you're missing by not looking else where?  How can you be sure that you've really found a genuine person when, given an infinite number of people, there's always bound to be someone better out there.  How can you be sure you're not settling? We simply can't.

It seems that we've bitten off more than we could chew with this whole interweb thingy.  We really created an existence for ourselves that we weren't prepared for.  We allowed ourselves to create an explosion that we can't know. One that ravages our mind, not in a physically destructive manner, but rather in a manner that _is_ that we cannot comprehend it! We've overloaded ourselves with information. Forcibly linked all the minds of all those in the world, our brains are now flooded with possibilities, choices, options, alternatives. Information, research, reviews, recommendations, comments, feedback, rantings and ravings, scrawlings and scribblings, poems, lyrics, verses, songs, satires, sensations, cinema, clips, comedies, creations, there's no end!

How can we ever take the time to know anyone? How much opportunity to find something else would we be missing? We all fear being alone. We all fear settling for someone. But, we all want to feel intimacy with others. We're not faced with adversaries and dilemmas, but with so many alternatives and options. How do you fight that?
