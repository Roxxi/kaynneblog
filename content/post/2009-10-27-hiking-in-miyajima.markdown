This morning, we started our day early, as Tristan and I met up with Tyson and Matias at 8 AM to get back to Miyajima and hike to the top of the island, Mt. Misen.  We went to 7 eleven, to grab some quick grub and water for breakfast, then set out on the Train to get to Miyajima all over again.

I swear, the JR pass is just so awesome. You just walk right through the gates, flashing your pass, no ticket, no hassle, nothing. Once we got to the end of the line, JR has a ferry to the island, also for free, just flash the pass, and off you go!

It was great returning to the island in the morning.  It was another beautiful day, sunny and warm, and the island is just gorgeous.  Matias wasn't with us yesterday, so it was his first trip to the island.  We walked around for a bit, letting him soak it all in. The beautiful Torii, that, now, since the tide was out you could nearly walk up to, looked even more spectacular when you're standing 10 meters away! Tristan and I took some pictures from a much, much closer distance. It was amazing seeing what was once completely covered in water the evening before, now dry enough for everyone to walk on and get rather close!  Compare!

Biiig difference! Apparently the story is that back in the day, only nobility could come to the island, and their ships would have to sail through this Torii in order for them to set foot on the island.

Anyway, after wandering around, admiring the beauty and the deer, who were out in a full force of cuteness, we set off for our hike from the base to the top of the mountain! We took the Daisho-in Trail, that first leads to a temple before breaking off into the mountain.  (The Daisho-in temple, specifically).  About 95% of the path up the mountain is hand made stone steps, leading for a couple miles up to the top. 

It was seriously one of the most beautiful and amazing climbs I've ever done.  Most of it was shrouded by beautiful pine trees, with frequent vista points overlooking the main land, the islands coast line, and various other islands surrounding Miyajima.  Not only that, but there were various small shrines all along the path, large shrines all the way across valleys in other hills on the mountain, beautiful birds, deer (of course), streams and rivers: the higher we got, the more amazing the views were!  It was sooo great!  It was also the first work out I've had in almost 2 weeks. I was sweating buckets (though we all were), but it was nothing but 2 hours of stairs all the way up.  Glorious, simply glorious!  The only thing that would've made it better would've been some Lady Gaga and Pussy Cat Dolls to listen to while climbing up!

Eventually we made it to the top, and found a number of large shrines built there, as well as shrine attendants servicing tourists and religious shrine-goers.

Matias couldn't get over how beautiful it was. After 5 months in Australia, he was so tired of seeing nothing (apparently outside of Sydney, it's nothing but desert for the most part, and considering he came from Italy, Australia doesn't seem to hold a torch, let alone a candle.)

On the summit there were also a nice set of deer sitting outside of the only store that sold some ice cream, water, soda, simple food, etc. looking for hand outs from the tourists.  They played it up, nice and cute, just like their sea-level brother, and we got to take some fun pictures with them while we rested up.

Originally we planned on hiking up and then back down the mountain, but after going through so many stairs, and with so many days left of nothing but walking around, we decided that we ought to just take the cable car/ rope way down.  We had another 20 minute hike to the peak across the way to get to the cable car station.  At the cable car station they had some billboards describing the monkeys that lived on the island that we wanted to see. As we looked around for them, we came across another sign that said:

Damn. No monkeys for us :(  We paid the ¥1000 to take the cable car back down. We couldn't believe it was so expensive. We saw where the cable car connected to, it wasn't even that far away! ¥1000?! No way! We could totally walk down. Well, that's what we thought until we got across from the cable car station to the rope-way station.  Wow, it was quite a few hundred feet we were saving by paying the ¥1000.  Both Matias and I are a bit scared of heights, and the rope way cars were tiny (fitting at most 6 people) as compared to the cable car, which fit about 15-20.  And the distance was huge. The trip took roughly 8 minutes from the top of the rope-way to the bottom, as compared to 3 minutes on the cable car. Just over 1,500 feet in 20 minutes, sugoi!

After we got to the bottom, we were starving.  We found an old man making grilled oysters, and we bought some to try them, as they're one of Miyajima's local specialties.  The man told us to put ponzu sauce on them, which, apparently is lemon juice, soy sauce, and vinegar.  It was really, really good with the fresh grilled oysters.  They were huge! And he was cracking them open right there on the grill, selling them straight away!  We found out later that they were farmed right off the coast of Miyajima.  Subarashi!

Then, I really, really wanted another Hiroshima style okonomiyaki, and our Italian friend hadn't had one yet, so we found a place to he could try it.  During lunch we were all pretty tired and quiet, but Matias explained to us that in Italy, all anyone eats is Italian food. He never had a single japanese dish until he came to japan. Not sushi, nothing that required using any chopsticks- all of the food was completely new to him. All three of us were kinda taken aback: we totally took for granted the kinds of food available to us in the US and Canada. I can't imagine having never had Japanese food.  He said in Italy they don't even eat french or German, or British or Mediterranean or Spanish food, all they eat is Italian. I was a bit shocked, but I kinda realized that in Japan, the food is heavily, predominantly Japanese.  There is foreign food, but just like we have "American Chinese food" they have "Japanese French food" etc.  I guess that's just how the world works.

After our well earned lunch, we caught the ferry back to the mainland, and headed back to the hostel to gather our belonging and head our separate ways.  Tyson and Matias were both off for Fukuyama (to the west) and we were off for Nagoya (to the east). We made our good byes and well wishes at the train station and headed to our seperate platforms.  

Oddly enough, we thought we'd be done and bored of Hiroshima in less than a day, and in the end, we ended up spending almost 2 and a half days here having a great time! We saw everything there was to see, got an amazing hike in, and tried the three local cuisines hiroshima is known for: Oysters, Okonomiyaki, and their Maple Leaf Shaped Pancake Sweets.

Cheers, Hiroshima!
