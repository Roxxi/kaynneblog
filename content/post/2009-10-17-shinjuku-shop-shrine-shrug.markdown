After finally finding Alex and Max an all day JR pass, we got on the train and headed to Shinjuku. After spending all this time on the train, I finally caught an imperfect moment that, even three days later, I haven't seen repeated- litter on the train!

30 minutes later, we finally made it to shinjuku! A trip that should've taken us about 40 minutes, ended up taking about 2 hours, heh. But, it was pretty fun!

In the train station, we were greeted with the usual Japanese fetish- a cosplay chibi character trying to sell us something through his cuteness.

What we didn't realize was that the trainstation was underneath a huuuuge shopping district, that extended many floors up, starting at the train station.  The first floor was a prepared food market, which each stand sold it's one speciality, whether it was cakes, imigawayaki?, tempura, sushi, meatballs, yakitori (meat on sticks- I dunno if it's limited to just chicken), rice gluten desserts: each any everyone of them looked sooo delicious! We were kind of sad we had eaten so recently. Any number of those things would've been great.  Alex and I got to taste some cow tongue meat balls (which actually weren't too bad, and I'm a little surprised my first time trying cow tongue was in japan, given the number of taquerias around me), and some citrus cheesecake (which wasn't identfiable until we ate it). Everything was just made to perfection- the display and wrapping of things was emacculate. The shock was actually less from the perfection, but more from the consistent attention to detail across every single food item we've seen, whether it was in this mall or train station, or anywhere else for that matter.

Alex has been looking for Georgio Armani's Aqua Di Gio cologne in australia, and was complaining because the price was so high there.  He said in the US, it's about $50 a bottle for the $100 bottles in Austrailia. Whatever. He was a man on a mission, from that point forward, and we climbed all through a department store looking for it, and browsing around at all the clothes, and different items for sale.

Imagine the Bloomingdales or Nordstorms in San Francisco. Two weeks ago, when I went shopping with Matt, I couldn't believe Macy's had a seperate 4 story building for men's clothes just on it's own. This store, had entire levels devoted to each department, that were extremely huge! Totally over shadows anything we have.  Not only that, but literally, every 5-6 feet, was a person who managed that section (whether it was wallets, or shoes, or jackets, and then for larger brands, someone who managed that particular brand), each and everyone one of them said "welcome" as we walked by, and stood ready to help us if we needed it. It was just amazing, compared to wandering around our department stores looking for a place to pay, trying to get help or find service- there was always someone there ready to help you.

Not only that, but the price tag on everything in there was crazy. The stores were pretty full of people, but the price tags on things were 400 to 600 to 1500 dollars, easily. Does Japan really have that many people that they need that kind of volume of stores to cater to that crowd? Sheesh.

After getting our fill of the department stores, (an giving up on finding Aqua Di Gio, ps: almost the entire first floor was perfume, except for one, tiny tiny little corner that had a few bottles of cologne. I guess cologne isn't big in Japan) we headed outside.  We came across a map, and saw a park that had a shrine in it. We thought we'd go and see that since we really hadn't seen one yet.  It was quite a ways away, so we plotted a course and began casually heading towards it.  On the way we stopped and took some silly pictures of ourselves and the buildings. One building in particular is part of the defining architecture of the region.

On our way around, we kept noticing how nice all the cars were around us.  We even caught sight of two, rather pretty and expensive cars:

About the time we had found the park, (which took us a bit, since we got turned around a couple times), we realized we were pretty hungry, especially after staring at all the food in the mall- which was now about an hour or so behind us.  We started looking for food. Alex really wanted sushi, and none of us had any qualm with that, have not yet tried sushi in Japan, so we figured how hard could it be to find sushi?

Miiisttaaaakkkeee.  It was pretty hard- in fact, we had wandered so far away from the train station, that all we could find were some scattered noodle shops (unless we wanted to pay out to eat at rather shishi places- which, since they were students, they didn't.) We thought if we'd head in the direction of the station, that we'd probably start seeing more restaurants, so we walked around the outer permiter of the park, and made what we thought would be a "U" back to the train station.  Sadly, we didn't seem to find any food.  

From the permitter of the park, we caught some glimpses of what lay inside.  It was pretty nice- there were basketball courts and soccer areas, and people playing rugby- mostly fathers with their kids or just kids.  The basketball courts were kinda funny because the hoops looked rather low. I joked that i should go in there and start dunking the ball, and Alex said I'd be a Shaq among them, hehe.

There were lots of pretty city architectural structures, and plenty of benches.

[caption id="attachment_292" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="A nice restful area  along side and below the main road"]![A nice restful area  along side and below the main road](/img/2009/10/DSC_0129-300x199.jpg)[/caption]

One of the things I've come to love is that people here actually sit at the benches they build! In the US we have so much furniture (particularly in office buildings- but even on the street) that gets put there and it's rarely enjoyed.  Drives me nuts.  It was great seeing people almost everywhere there was a place to sit- enjoying the atmosphere, talking to someone, eating their lunch.  And it wasn't busy- it's not that there were so many people around that statistically *someone* would sit down- no, they were simply sitting there to enjoy themselves. 

Here's Tristan being an example of a good sitting citizen:

I gotta say, though, I did find another bad mark on a city that seems otherwise so perfect, after walking around for 2 hours, I finally found litter!

The one thing that's been rather hard is that there are no trash cans anywhere. And when there is a receptacle, it's almost exclusively recycling.  It's so hard to find places to throw away containers, boxes, and plastic bags.  What's worse is that despite the fact their food is immaculately packaged, in a rather ornate manner- there are so many component pieces of plastic and paper to the packaging, it generates a ton of waste! And then there's no where to throw it! Ugh!  We've been carrying all our trash with us, for most of the trip so far, until we either made it back to the hostile or happened to stumble upon a receptacle.

Enough with all the serious stuff. Look, this turtle is trying to get into the building!

Anyhow, needless to say, we gave up on finding sushi, and decided, that, since we were so close to the park, we'd just get a snack at AM/PM (which they have here as plentifully as 7-Eleven's), and check things out in the park.  

**Aside:** Mr Fix, this place totally caters to you. You should've come!

After wandering around the park for a little bit, we found the shrine we had, an hour or so earlier, set out to find.

[caption id="attachment_317" align="aligncenter" width="199" caption="The shrine!"]![The shrine!](/img/2009/10/DSC_0151-199x300.jpg)[/caption]

It was rather odd seeing the juxtaposition of an ancient looking shrine, with sky scrapers behind it.

[caption id="attachment_318" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="O.o"]![O.o](/img/2009/10/DSC_0149-300x199.jpg)[/caption]

But, regardless, it was great that we got to see it.  While we were there, a soon-to-be-married couple was there, having their pictures taken, as they walked up to the shrine to pay their offerings and ring the bells.  I didn't take any pictures out of reverence, but it was interesting to watch.  The shrine in the picture above is the main shrine in an area featuring several smaller ones.  Off to the side of it, we watched two older women do a little ceremony with a dragon water fountain, that was rather calmly pouring water.

[caption id="attachment_319" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Nice little fountain"]![Nice little fountain](/img/2009/10/DSC_0155-300x199.jpg)[/caption]

Alex and I watched what the women were doing, and decided to imitate it.  In turn, we approached the fountain, grabbed one of the ladles, and picked some water up from the sectioned area where the water was falling from the dragons mouth, and spilled it on the sectioned area that was closest to us. (The bamboo sticks over the water, partitioned it in to regions). We then filled the ladle from the dragon's mouth, and drank some of the water, and poured the rest out.  Didn't taste too bad, but we had no idea what the significance was. Not a single sign in English anywhere.

We wandered around the shrine area a bit more, and it's really rather peaceful and pleasant all around it. One of the little shrines on the side seemed to be a Fox shrine. Most of the others, we really couldn't figure out their significance- but, for me, the take away was that it seemed a lot more elegant in general compared to the religious expressions of Christianity (with the exception of cathedrals)

After visiting the shines, we began walking around and exploring the park.  Just up the hill from the Shrine, we saw a small clearing with a bunch of blue tents made out of those blue tarps.  "I guess Tokyo has bums too," I thought to myself. But then I looked inside one of the tents- holy crap! It was soo well organized and clean! How could I expect any less from the Japanese homeless.  It was a rather respectable little shanty.  As we kept following the path, we saw the owner of the little settlement, and he was washing himself in the near by drinking fountain.  I can't say I've ever seen a bum in San Francisco who ever made it look like he had made any attempt to wash himself.  It really was quite a sight to see.

As we kept walking further a long, we came to a little waterfall along the path way, and decided to take a seat, since we hadn't sat down in quite a while.

As we were resting, a small orange and white cat came out of the bushes, and walked right in front of us, like he didn't care that we were sitting there at all. Most cats I've seen in general are rather skittish- but not this cat. It was his territory, and he knew he was the king.  He say rather close to us for a while, watching us from about 3 feet away, sizing us up, probably trying to figure out why we didn't sound Japanese.  He watched some of the other tourists, cleaned himself- was just making the rounds, I suppose. It was pretty clear he was a stray from the infections near his eyes.

[caption id="attachment_328" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Neko-sama, The Feline Daimyo"]![Neko-sama, The Feline Daimyo](/img/2009/10/DSC_0182-300x199.jpg)[/caption]

After he got bored sitting near us, he started walking down the road back the way we came. Then he noticed a man coming from the bottom part of a T-intersection (walking toward the top of the T). When the man saw the cat, he stopped walking and stared at the cat.  The cat then sat down right in the middle of the intersection, in the middle of the road, and stared at the man.  The main patiently waited there for about a minute, while we're watching this scene, wondering if the man really wouldn't cross the path of the cat. After about another 30 seconds, the man finally turned around and went back the way he came! Neko-sama didn't care in the least for him!  And even after that, Neko-sama just stayed where he was in the middle of the road. A bicycle came by, got within 2 feet of him without slowing down, and went right by, and Neko-sama did not even a flinch.   We were pretty impressed with this cat.  Then, all of a sudden around the corner we see two women coming with two large dogs. "Alright, NOW this is going to get good," one of us quipped. "Those dogs are going to go crazy when they see him." Sure enough, as soon as those dogs caught sight of Neko-sama, they began pulling on their owners leashes, frantically wanting to run up to him, and the owners were fighting back with all their weight (which wasn't much) to keep the dogs under control.  But Neko-sama was unconcerned.  Didn't move, didn't even get up. Didn't meow, nor hiss!  He couldn't have cared whether there were 2 dogs or 200: this was his domain.  And the owners pulled their dogs around Neko-sama, and didn't dare cross him either, going down the long leg in the T, rather than coming across to us. Craaazy.

After all that excitement, we decided to get up and continue on.  We walked down around the water fall to the other side, where there was a slightly larger waterfall facing a large open space of asphalt.  A group of people were skateboarding, doing tricks and practicing (teenagers, and one father with his 6 year old son- the father had a pretty awesome long board, that Max said he had modded in a way he had never seen), while another group of people had blankets set up on the ground and were selling all sorts of miscellaneous goods (just like they do in the streets in the Mission on weekends). We're not going to ask where the goods came from.  Tristan, Max, and I sat down to watch the skateboarders do their thing, while Alex went to go look at what the people were selling.  10 minutes go by, and Alex comes back and says this guy is selling a really awesome ivory dagger, made from real ivory! He really wants it, but the guy wants ¥13000 for it (which is about $150) Offered him ¥3000 for it and the guy obviously declined.  After about 10 minutes of sitting with us, he couldn't stop talking about the dagger, and how it was all hand-engraved, and looked really cool, etc etc. I finally said, "Fine, let's go see this dagger!" and we walked over to the man who was selling it.  I saw it. Neat. Ivory. Dagger. Cool. What are you going to do with this? Eh. He wanted it, so he started haggling with the guy, starting at ¥5000.  I walked away, not wanting to get involved, and after 5 minutes, he came back with his prized dagger in hand, for ¥6500.  Hooray! He was pretty excited- and on a vacation, that's all that matters :)

After all the excitement, we decided to head back to the train station to get our long awaited sushi. Earlier when we were looking for sushi, we ran in to some people who gave us a recommendation that their hotel gave them for a place at the train station. We decided to go and track that down, since, at least, it was a real recommendation.  As we were walking back, we passed a little food/shopping center, and on the set of signs in front, Max and I both noticed one of the signs said "Sizzler"

[caption id="attachment_331" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="OMG, no wai! Really? >.>"]![OMG, no wai! Really? >.>](/img/2009/10/DSC_0190-300x199.jpg)[/caption]

"No way!" we thought, "Why would there be a sizzler here!" But sure enough, we look up, and we see two little girls at a table with a white table cloth! Wow, a white table cloth! What a sizzler!

[caption id="attachment_332" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="-_-*"]![-_-*](/img/2009/10/DSC_0192-300x199.jpg)[/caption]

Anyway, we made it to the train station (and man, train station entrances are huge. It took us like 10 minutes to walk to the center of the station from the south gate), and we tried to find the sushi place that we had written down on a piece of paper.  After asking a policeman where to find the place, we thought we were close, but our hunger over came us, and we just went to the first sushi place we saw.  Yay, no English there! Nor a menu to point at!

So, we didn't realize you couldn't (or shouldn't) order multiple pieces of sushi at a time.  The chef just ignored our orders if they went beyond one or two kinds of fish, and only gave us 2 pieces at a time. Sadly, after we came in, a group of 4 more people came in, and the place became rather busy. We all only got 4 pairs of sushi each (which, for us, was not nearly enough, since we were starving!), but we decided that we had better move on, since we weren't really sure how much it was costing us.  Those 4 pieces cost us about $15 bucks each. Yeoch. *shrug* Ah well, it was good, and at least we had some :).

From there... off to Harajuku...
