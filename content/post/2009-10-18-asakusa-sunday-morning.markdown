Asakusa Sunday Morning

Alex and Max came into our room sometime around 4 AM (I found out later, they shelled out $50 for a cab), and sometime just after that another girl appeared in one of the bunk beds as well. Max was awake, still kinda drunk, and the following conversation took place:

"Hi, I'm Max, what's your name?"
"I'm Erica"
"Where are you from?"
"I'm Erica"
"Ok... where are you from?"
"I'm from America"
"Cool."

...and that's how we met "Erica from America."

Then they both went to sleep.  Strange conversation.  Around 5:30 Am, yet another girl stumbled in to our room. (Who did stay up all night so she could take the subway back from partying.) All of a sudden our room was at capacity, 6 out of 6 beds filled.

Sadly, it was a night and morning full of interruptions. Both girls came in late and went out early.  It was a rather hard to sleep with the lights coming on and off, the girls not really trying to be considerate about noise, people going to the bathroom.  Blech, heh. It was too much- but we tried to get what sleep we could.

Around 9:30 all four of us ended up waking up, and we decided we'd head out for breakfast together then figure out what to do for the day.  Alex and Max had made arrangements the previous day to head to a hostel that was in Tokyo proper called the Ninja Hostel, since, apparently, it had a reputation for having wild parties.  Given that Alex and Max were here, skipping 7 days of class because they found $400 tickets to Tokyo, it seemed that they were ready for more of a party than Tristan and I were. (It also helped them out that their native timezone was only 1 hour off from ours, so they weren't nearly as jetlagged.)  They were encouraging us to go with them, but we weren't quite sure what we were doing.  As it was, Tristan and I only had arrangements through today (sunday). We didn't know where we were going next or what we were doing. Given how much we struggled just to get from the airport to Tokyo, I think we both felt a little down about how difficult getting around was, and were apprehensive to really get wind in our sails and get moving...but, first things first, time for breakfast!

After getting dressed, we headed out back to Asakusa's little open air market area at the main temple there (I'll fill in the name later). Today the market place was totally bussling, and it seemed that there was some ceremony going on today at the shrine there.  As we were walking down the main drag, about to look for food, all of a sudden we notice that a procession is coming down the street.

It wasn't a big parade or anything, but there were guys with a big golden dragon coming down the road, and a cart full of geisha, playing live music, with a group of men hitting drums and cymbals behind them.

The music was rather classical sounding, an really pretty, and everyone was taking pictures and watching.  Seemed we picked a good weekend- it just so happened to be Asakusa's birthday weekend! Happy Birthday Asakusa! And, go us for picking a place at random and ending up at a party :).  There were plenty of kids' games that were set up, lots of fair food, and people visiting the shrines, and giving offerings. It was a beautiful day, and everyone was just out enjoying the sun.  It was just like anime! It was pretty cool. We wanted to stay longer, but our hunger was nagging us.

Alex thought he remembered where some place he really wanted to eat was.  Alex didn't like eating the same things in a row (unlike Max, who could eat ramen over and over and over, and apparently did at home), so today he was trying to take us some place he had seen for god knows what. Alas, he never found it. Wandering trying to figure out what to have instead, Alex poked his head in a shop, and before we knew it the owner was outside talking to him, trying to explain what exactly was on the menu, in really broken english. Eventually he said "okonomiyaki" and it caught my ear! So I tried to help explain it to them too, since no one else had ever heard of okonomiyaki, and the guy was trying to explain it to them. I had an imperfect memory of what it was, but I had told them I had it before (which I had, back in 9th grade), and it was really good (which I lied about, since I didn't like it the one time I had it), but I figured we were hungry enough that anything would taste good, and I was probably young and overly picky when I had it.

So, anyway, I convinced everyone to just give it a try, and the owner of the shop invited us in.  We were seated at a table that had a big flat iron griddle in the center of it. We weren't quite sure what to make of that, nor what to order since everything was japanese, We ended up ordering a seafood okonomiyaki, and seafood manjayaki (Mahn-JAH-yaki). None of us had ever heard of manjayaki, but we saw a picture and it looked unobjectionable. 

They turned the gas on underneath the griddle on our table, letting it get hot. They soon brought out a small of vegetables in some liquid, and began mixing them at our table. They then poured some oil and brushed the griddle, and dumped the contents on to it.  They shaped it in to a nice circle, after mixing it some and cutting up the bigger clumps. Then once one side started to cook, they flipped it over and cooked the other side.  It was fun having them cook at the table. We were kind of surprised.

Though it was small, in the end (probably 6" in diameter) it was quite tasty, and we ate it hungrily.

Now, for the manjayaki, they brought out another bowl that looked like it was filled with the exact same thing.  This time, when they dumped it out, a large pool of liquid was left at the bottom, and a great amount of liquid came out with the veggies and assorted fish.  This time, rather than clumping it all in the center, they let it cook until the liquid started to disappear, then pushed all of the food in to a ring, pouring the rest of the liquid in to the center, and turning down the heat some.  They explained that this was Tokyo style BBQ soup!  Way cool! I never had bbq soup before.  Instead of using chopsticks or spoons, they had these little silver [garden] spade like things, probably about the size of a typical teaspoon, but completely flat.  To eat the soup, you were supposed to scrape it off the grill. They turn off the heat so it doesn't all evaporate, and you just go at it, in a free for all fest.  It was really, really good! Quite a unique experience!

Sadly, it was still a rather small portion of food, so we ordered another okonomiyaki.  The other Alex mixed it, and I ended up cooking it on the grill. We didn't realize they were teaching us how to do it, until they handed the bowl to us.  It seemed they had other customers to tend to. It was fun making our own :).

Anyhow, after our find dining experience, Alex and Max needed to check out of our hostel and in to their new one, and Tristan and I hadn't yet made plans for the rest of our trip, and tonight was our last night in Tokyo, and we didn't know where we were going next.  We agreed to meet up with them later in the afternoon, so Tristan and I could make our plans, and they could go check in.

After splitting up, Tristan and I decided to go check out the fair a bit before getting down to business. The fair as packed! If you look at my blog entry from the first night, you'll see a giant gate, area that was mostly open- wellâ€¦ now it was completely full with people!

I wanted to try some fair food item, even though we were full now.  I saw chocolate covered banana's earlier, and that sounded rather good.  Tristan and I each got one (though I got one covered with strawberry substance), they were pretty great :)

After getting our dessert, we walked around some, and looked at the people at the shrines, buying charms, making offerings and saying prayers.  We found a little bridge with a koi pond below, and I took some pictures of the small statues and koi around it.

We then walked out behind the fair area, and found a statue of a man dressed as a samurai, who apparently was a great actor, so much so, they made a larger than life size statue of him.

After that, we decided to get back to the hostel and get down to business.
