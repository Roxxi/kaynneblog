I can't believe how awesome the weather is up here. I feel like it's such a waste to not be outside every weekend that the weather is nice.  If you happen to know of anything, or feel like hiking, or camping for a day, or doing **anything out doors!** Let me know and I'll be right on it :D

I went to Santa Cruz yesterday. Talk about people watching overload.  Just walking around down town... I've never seen so many different kinds of beggars all at once. Musician beggars, teenage beggars, war victim beggars, lazy beggers: there was even a beggar tickling a woman's foot!  How crazy!  There were also tough guys, pansy guys, lots of lesbians, gay guys, geeky guys, artists, old people galore, arguing eastern europeans, rich, control-freak executive, single parent families (or people on single parent outings).

I saw some people fishing on the pier. I still really wanna go fishing. Some people I talk to say that fishing is easy. Others say it's very technical and knowing which bait and which lures is important.

So many things I want to do. I should write them all down... Maybe I will!

Tomorrow is going to be great! New Panic! At the Disco album comes out, I can't wait!
