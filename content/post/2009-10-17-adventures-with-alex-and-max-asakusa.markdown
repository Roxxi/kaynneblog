After our delicious breakfast, Tristan and I came back to the hostel to figure out what the hell we were going to do for the day.  Our roommates came down and joined us after they eventually woke up, and asked what we were going to do.  We said we didn't really know, and that we needed to figure that out. They said they were heading to Shinjuku to get lost and see what was around there.  Sounded good to us. Mutually inviting ourselves, they invited us to join them, and we set out for adventure! To the subway station!

Just a couple blocks to the east of our hostel, we were surprised to find a rather large, and not very discrete porn theater! The part that was amazing, is that it was basically a directly across from an amusement park entrance for kids! It's strange seeing something that's rather adult oriented by something that's rather not- but then, how bad is it really? It doesn't stay the big evil, if it's known and talked about... and they're *such* a sexually repressed culture... but... anyway, we're tourists, so our amazement amused them even more! The old men were laughing at us as we were gawking and taking pictures.

After bemusing ourselves with that, we headed toward the subway station, but, on the way we found a 7 eleven

For the most part, it was the same as our 7 elevens (a little smaller, actually) but the food in the cold case was SOOO much better!

Even more amazingly, they had a hot case! Which I had never seen before, where coffee's and tea's were all super heated in a case, ready for a hot consumption. The case was completely exposed to the air though! It seemed like a ridiculous waste of energy.

Anyway, after getting some snacks, (breakfast for our Canadian-school-going-Austrialian friends), we headed down to the subway. Man, the walk to the subway was looong. You just keep going down, and down, and down, and down. It's really amazing how far down it goes.  About half way down was a really awesome bike rack! For 100¥ you could park your bike all day in to a rack that'd automatically lock it!

After all the walking, we finally made it to the train. I don't remember if I said this yesterday, but DAAANG, the trains here are super clean! And super quiet! It's not like Bart at all! You can talk, and hear each other with no strain, and at not point do you have to cover your ears to block out the screeching of the track.  The seats also don't smell like BO.  The windows are even so clean, you can see you're reflection in them!

Anyhow, on to Akihabara to switch to the JR to get to Shinjuku!
