First things first, time for breakfast!

It was around 9 o'clock when Tristan and I woke up, got ready, and left the hostel in search of food. We headed back to the main drag near the park we were staying at.  Upon reading a bit about the district we're in (Asakusa) it seems that the long row of vendors is the result of the area being a traditional trading area.  This time, now, we were perhaps a bit too early (as opposed to too late), and all of the food street vendors were still preparing food. ;_; After walking the same walk I did 3 times the night before, desperately looking for food, I went back to one of the stands and bought some taiyaki-like cakes. But no, this wasn't good enough for Tristan, who wanted a *real* breakfast.  After eating two little pancakes (four could fit in my hand), we kept going until we found a noodle shop that had a system we could order at! Amazing! Food! Finally! 

So, how did it work? Well, there's all the fake food outside, like most places, and each item has a number by the food. Sounds easy, right? Just go in and ask for the number? Well... it was even easier! You just walked to a vending machine right next to the restaurant, put the coins in, and pushed a number that corresponded to the food you wanted.  You then got a ticket, that you took inside the restaurant, handed to the woman, and she prepared your food! Itadakimas!

Here are our first meals, mine and Tristan's!

Yaaay! We did it! We found food!
