Our last moment in the US! Adorable!

And now we made it to Japan!Â  We landed almost an hour early!

[![](/img/2009/10/p_480_320_56B09219-6281-4775-B21D-03F96F007131.jpeg)](/img/2009/10/p_480_320_56B09219-6281-4775-B21D-03F96F007131.jpeg)

Let's break things up into two sections- the flight, and the first looooong moments being a total foreigner. (if my sentences are rather rambly right now, it's 2:15am SFO time.)

First, the flight:

The seat size ended up being totally fine. Sure, it wasn't the most comfortable thing, but it wasn't terrible. The guy in front of me ended up reclined the entire trip, so I had to make the best of what space I had. I was happy that he was able to recline, after reading horror stories of tall people who were so tall that the person infront of them couldn't recline, in which the unhorizontifiable person complained to the flight attendent, who then told the tall person that they had to let the person in front of them recline or else. Or else what? The person never really found out, but it sounded like a yelling match ensued, and, after hearing that story,  I was really worried about that happening to me. But alas, a 32" seat pitch and 17" wide seats on the airbus A300 was enough to keep me, and my column companion comfortable.

So how was the food? Well, as I mentioned walker, Tristan and I had lunch right before getting on the plane. We kind of figured since it was an 11 hour flight that we'd probably be fed after each 4 hour leg of the journey. Nope! Instead we had "dinner" at 2:30 pm SFO/ 10:30 pm Tokyo time (which didn't make much sense on either time zone), about 1.5 hours in to the flight! Ok, strange, but whatever. The food was pretty good, so not much to complaint about there. After that, though, we didn't eat again until about 1.5 hours before we landed! To have breakfast, at what was 2:30 pm Tokyo time, or 10:30 pm ish our time. Again, where in the world should we be to be having breakfast. Sadly, the omlette and potatoes and sausage were rather "eh," but by then, it had been so long since we had eaten we were starving. Ah well. The best part, though, and there was one, was that beer and wine were free :-D. I never experienced that before, but I think it's because I was 20 when I went to England.

Here's a picture of our dinner! And our Menu! Hail the Cheesy Grits!

So what about in flight entertainment? Well, like everyone else, Northwest has those built in TVs. Now, the only ones I've ever used before were Virgin America's, and that totally spoiled me. To say the least, god awful user interface, with an awfully designed controller. Tristan even managed to crash the system and cause it to reboot, revealing that it was running Linux.  Why is this important! It's not. There was a multiplayer trivia game that we tried playing, but no one would ever play with us :-/. Other than that, there were standard single player games, like bejeweled, solitaire, and mahjong, but, since the controller was so hard to use, they were practically unplayable. During the quiz game, after you answered a question, it would display a fun fact. Many of them were hilariously inane, for example, one of the answers to a question was "Dolly Parton." after the answer was revealed, the game thought than "we might find it interesting to know..." (that was the template) "...Dolly Par ton." *blank stare* what. I took a picture of another similar enlightening fact below.

[![](/img/2009/10/l_2048_1536_A29C28E6-EE69-49EF-80FA-8DB4FF05B261.jpeg)](/img/2009/10/l_2048_1536_A29C28E6-EE69-49EF-80FA-8DB4FF05B261.jpeg)

Alright, so games were a bust, what about movies? Well, amazingly enough they didn't skimp at all! There were about 20 great titles to choose from. I ended up watching wolverine (omg Hugh Jackman *drool*) and Tristan watched Star Trek. It would have been great except that I had to select movie four times before it would actually play it, instead of playing other movies at random.

Aside from that, no one sitting around us was very interesting at all, except for some boisterously loud eastern European woman, who, upon getting on the plane, had the volume level of someone at a Raiders game (or what I imagine Denver would sound like at a raiders game ;-) ). Thankfully, her son or husband likely put something in her drink and she passed out for almost the entire flight.

Upon descent, we were both enamored with the lovely Japanese country side. The most adorable looking towns, bridges, scattered farm houses- it really looked pretty awesome. Rather than the huge, sprawling farms of the central valley, each plot was rather small, and the way the houses weren't clumped in to a single central spot, really gave you a feel that many families owned many farms, rather than one family owning many farms. It was quite a nice sight.

Yeah, see? Mostly uneventful on the flight. Really had to pull for some of those :)

Ok, so now it's about 5 hours later. We made it to the hostel. I put Tristan to bed, and came down so I could record the rest of what happened. Poor guy, he barely slept at all on the plane, and once we go to the airport, I bought my first vending machine item: a big bottle of tea- so I'm considerably more awake.

Well, upon getting off the airplane, we took one thing at a time. First things first was the long, meandering route to the passport area. Amazingly enough, only about 7 of us needed to go through that. The place was totally empty. It looked like they could've handled 300 people at a given moment. For the two of us, it was totally over kill.  Though this is probably true in other countries, we had to be finger printed, and they took a picture of us, all electronically. The woman had to aim the camera up considerably, which she laughed about, bringing the, "wow, you're awkwardly tall"-laugh count to 1. Thanks immigration woman for being my first WYAT-Laugh!

After immigration we got our luggage, went through customs, which went something like, "Hi, did you bring anything?" "No." "How long are you staying?" "Two weeks." "Ok, thanks, have fun." How on earth do they catch people? All of this was a no brainer. Now, after following the continually meandering hallways all through the airport, we finally made it to the exit area, and our real issues started. Guess what the first thing we saw was?

[![](/img/2009/10/l_2048_1536_98A80CBB-FE1A-4FC9-BE0D-15F22765B12A.jpeg)](/img/2009/10/l_2048_1536_98A80CBB-FE1A-4FC9-BE0D-15F22765B12A.jpeg)

Yeah. Bleh. Smells just as bad as the US ones. All burned up.

All in all, getting from the plane to this point took half an hour, not bad at all. Next our path was unclear. First, we had too many large bills. We had to find a place that could "break a hundred" effectively. The currency office could only break one 100 for each of us, so, at least we had some smaller denominations. Now we were faced with, "how the fuck do we get to our hostel?"

I booked our hostel without knowing anything about where it was in relation to anything. I basically picked the first place that didn't have bad reviews, that didn't have a curfew, that could accommodate us, and that could take credit card. I didn't really reflect on location, or how to get there.  Now, the other thing I didn't realize is that Tokyo is a good hour to two hours away from Narita by train/subway, etc, and what's worse is that there isn't one clear way to get from Narita to Tokyo- and I don't mean, you could take a bus, a shuttle, a cab, a train, or something else... I mean, there are 3-4 different kinds of trains that all run from the airport to various places. Not only did we not know where we were staying, but even if we did, we wouldn't know which train to take! Blarg! And everything being in Japanese script made it particularly hard to read. Long story short, it took us about an hour to figure out where our hostel was, figure out how we could get there, find someone who could tell us where that train was, buy a ticket, get our rail passes (which we didn't use for this purpose), and get on a train to get here. Keep in mind, it's roughly 2 AM for us at this point on American time. We're pretty tired, and attention span is running short.

We get on our train, and realize that we need to transfer half way through at a stop called Aoto. Sadly, among all the other japanese words, and our complete attention deficit, it seemed almost impossible to focus long enough to listen for "Aoto" in the stream of information coming from the conductor. I eventually gave up and started writing this entry on my iPhone, in hopes that Tristan would catch it.  Well, that smarty man Tristan found a scrolling marquis that was blocked out of my view that said the name of each stop in English, but he neglected to tell me about it. So, I was sitting there worried about missing hearing or watching for the stop out the window (from which I could barely discern what stop we were at at any given time- it's hard to know which word is what). But, we make it, get off, and make our transfer, and finally make it to the stop (Asakusa) for our hostel (Asakusa Sakura Hostel). We emerged from the train station, left with one final task: where the hell is our hostel from here?

iPhone to the rescue! Compass app go! We find north, and start heading up the street in the right direction. We reason it should be fairly close to the station. We make it to the first corner and come across a map that says "You are here" Hooray! As Tristan and I argue about which way to go next, a man comes to us and says "Information" and points to a small building behind us. Heh, how dumb we look, trying to figure out where to go when a tourist information building is behind us, clearly labeled.  The nice people inside help orient us, and tell us it's about an 8 minute walk away, through a large park, where there's a gate and temple.

Here was the first neon sign we saw!

[![](/img/2009/10/p_2048_1536_0273ABD7-DB51-433E-81F8-78DE4E455AB0.jpeg)](/img/2009/10/p_2048_1536_0273ABD7-DB51-433E-81F8-78DE4E455AB0.jpeg)

We leave the building, and find the park entrance, and see a huge temple arches thingy (I forget what they're called, I'm tired.... gate?) and there are literally 30-40 school kids, all wearing boys and girls uniforms, all around the grounds. "Getting off of school at 7 PM?" Tristan and I wonder. "It's so exciting! They're wearing uniforms, just like it's anime in real life ><," says me! It was pretty amazing seeing stuff that I've seen so long in an animated context actually being based in reality. All of them were taking pictures with their cell phone cameras, wandering around in segregated groups of boys and girls. It was really quite interesting.  We came to the temple, which was HUUUGE. I took a picture!

[![](/img/2009/10/p_2048_1536_2995173F-25C5-474E-AD5C-7295DCE79A2B.jpeg)](/img/2009/10/p_2048_1536_2995173F-25C5-474E-AD5C-7295DCE79A2B.jpeg)

It seems the hostile location I picked was in a great area. There were rows of streets with all sorts of street merchants out! Making delicious smelling food! Yum! I was soo hungry! But Tristan was tired, so we had to get to the hostile.

Eventually, with only a tiny bit more trouble, we found the hostile! Yay! We checked in, got our bed, room, and linen assignments, and went upstairs to check out our digs.  Not bad! 3 bunk beds, with (at least) 3 Australian roommates, who seemed pretty friendly.  I didn't meet them right away. I was hungry after passing all that food, so I left Tristan to get to bed, while I went out for a walk to find some of that food we passed.!

To our surprise, when we arrived, it was an amazing October evening! About 73 degrees outside, it was like a warm summer night! As I ventured out, now alone, I was sad to discover that every street food vendor had packed up and moved back inside :(.  "Noooooo! I'm soooo hungry!" I yelled in my head. I walked for about 20-30 minutes, before finally giving up. With the food vendors outside, I could point to order- but now the only restaurants open, I would have to go inside and order :( I'm just too tired to be exceptionally brave right now and think up a communication strategy.  I walked passed a restaurant that said "English Menu" in the window, and I thought, hooray! But, by the time i saw the sign, I was too self conscious to turn around.  There were so many people around me, I didn't want them to think me a total pleeb. (Irrational, I know, but I'm tired! :p) I ended up taking another walk around the block, hoping I'd come across a similar sign once again. Sadly I didn't.  Returning to the restaurant that had the sign, I once again almost passed it by the time I saw it. I stopped and considered going in, but I decided I'd be too self conscious, not knowing an ounce of Japanese.  Eventually I just gave up and returned to the hostile, and bought a 200Â¥ bowl of instant ramen :P Bleh.  Ah well, at least I ate *something.*

After my cop-out-pussy dinner, I went back upstairs to grab my laptop so I could write all this, and I discovered Tristan, not only not asleep, but sitting in the room with our 3 Australian roommates! Haha, poor guy! Desperately wants to sleep and isn't going to get the chance till later.  I said my hellos, but I was too tired to follow conversation. The interesting thing was they had toootally Californian accents. They didn't sound Australian at all. I had my doubts, that maybe they were American instead, until they all started saying "Uni."  Interesting :)

Alright, I've been sitting down here for the last hour writing all this down. It's almost 10 here now, so I should get ready to go to bed!
