Is a terrible terrible thing.  I have learned a lot about it in the last 72 hours.  I learned that everytime your body gets it, it remembers how awful it is, and does everything it can in order to fight it.  I learned that all this effort is largely wasted because, sadly, poison oak is not an infection, but rather a toxin. As a result you may need to take a drug to "turn down" your immune system in order to lessen the suffering.

Among other things, I learned that binding afflicted areas and keeping them totally untouchable is a great way to fight the itch.  It seems that histamine blocker creams, such as Benadryl, are mostly useless.  Ice is amazing. Water is amazing.

Probably worse than the itching itself is the fact that it only takes a very small amount of oil to induce a reaction, and, as such, you have to clean **everything**.  Everything you could have touched. Everything that anyone could have touched, anything that might have been touched by anything.

A very useful and interesting website that I found during my reading was http://waynesword.palomar.edu/ww0802.htm  It was interesting how they had many people comment on methods, drugs, scrubs, and various other technique's that have been tried.

I have to say, I was given a prescription of prednizone- and I was pretty skeptical about it, but surprisingly enough, it worked very quickly, and- aside from the incurable itching, within 2-3 days, the swelling stopped, the "weeping" stopped, and the pain has subsided to some degree.
