All packed with -5 minutes to spare, Tristan and I made it to our flight, prepped and ready. I must have been nervous this morning because when I got to the airport I discovered I hadn't quite washed the soap out of my hair. 

After finishing my shower in the bathroom sink, Tristan and I found some lunch that was pretty good in the terminal and headed to board the plane. 

It's been a long time since i've been on a plane quite this large, with seats 2-3-2 across. Amazingly enough I fit into the seat reasonably well, although, let's see how I feel about that after a 12 hour flight, and after the person infront of me reclines (which I hope he never considers).

Yay, the flight attendant is fading is the emergency infomation on Japanese, sounds so kawaiii^_^~

I added some pictures of our inflight menu- I love that the last ameicanish meal I may have includes cheesy grits. They gave us free headphones too! (yeah Bryan, I know I already paid for them :-p)
