Well, after a 2 hour delay sitting on the plane in SFO, we finally took off.  After enjoying a relatively tasty dinner of stewed meat chunks in tomato juice, and watching Morning Glory (which was a pretty good movie), I slept for 2-4 hours (I'm not entirely sure...) to wake up to a half sandwich that was simply two slices of soggy decrusted white bread, 2 pieces of dry bites of chicken, and some "vegatables." Ugh. I have to say, LAN is far from an impressive airline. We could barely understand **any** of the pilot's announcements, not because he couldn't speak english, but because the PA system was intolerably crappy. Aside from the the stewardesses weren't very interested in checking on people, never coming and offering drinks aside from meal times. Bleh.




But that all was tolerably unpleasant. Once we landed in Lima, for our "technical" stop, they deplaned everyone.  We were all confused because our tickets didn't show any connecting flight information, and aside from the flight attendants announcing that we had to get off the plane, no one explained that people on the Sao Paulo flight missed their connection (missed the connection that we weren't support to have, we were supposed to stay on the same plane), until 30 minutes later when we found ourselves being stuck in Lima for 6 hours to wait for a 7 AM flight to Santiago, to then take another flight after another lay over to get to Sao Paulo at 7 PM.




Again, not really the end of the world, just in convenient. The only really tough part is Dan had arranged a bus to pick everyone up from the airport and do the 4 hour drive to Itapeva, where the wedding is.  Sadly, originally we were supposed to land at 9 AM, the bus was originally going to leave at 1 PM.  Now we're landing at 7:30 PM, so by the time we go through customers, we probably won't be ready to leave until 9 PM- well after the bus leaves.




What's worse is we have no idea where the wedding is, the address of anything, nor anyway to contact them right now. Sadly the internet in the VIP lounge LAN is letting us wait in is super flakey, and I can't get through the process to buy skype credit, and none of our phones have roaming service here. Boo.




Ah well, it's still an adventure and spirits are pretty good. Tristan is probably suffering the most from not being able to sleep without lying down, but as I'm typing this, I may have caught him actually asleep in a chair!  He can't tell me he can't sleep in a chair anymore.

While we were waiting in line to see what they were going to do with us, a little boy who was really tired came up and grabbed Dean's leg and started hugging him. It was really cute- then his mom came from behind and whisper "That's not your father."  The kid didn't register the comment at first and continued hugging Dean's leg more intensely, until the mother repeated the sentence. The little boy looked up, saw Dean staring back at him (warmly, mind you) and quickly pulled back and ran to his mother.  Then 3-4 seconds passed and we continued talking, and all of a sudden the kid ran across the room and started whaling. I guess it took him a minute to realize he had embarrassed himself, and once he had, was so ashamed he wanted to run away. It was super adorable.  The poor kid was soo tired, especially after being on a plane for 11 hours. I remember feeling that way when I went to Lebanon when I was 9.




I've never been in a VIP lounge before. I have to admit it's pretty nice. There's free food, a juice machine in which you can stick 4 whole oranges in and watch it be squeezed into a glass of juice (which is fairly unnerving when you see how much fruit goes into so little juice), they had these little sandwiches with grape jam, and this sour-y cream-y kinda stuff inside. I dunno what it was, but it wasn't sour cream :P.  They have a private bar, which you have to pay for sadly- though it seems to be open late, as well as a sub-lounge where you can go to sleep, which is probably the best feature for a frequent traveller.

Oh well, I still think the lot of this is pretty fun, even if we may miss the wedding... On the upside, if we stay on Sao Paulo, we won't miss the honey moon :)




It was also neat to see ads for 3.5G networks in the airport. I guess the Peruvians don't need to lie to their people about "4G" networks.

Ah well. On to Santiago!
