I found a fantastic iPhone app for helping me count calories called [Lose it!](itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=297368629&mt=8) (also found[ here](http://www.ipodtouchapps.org/the-lose-it-iphone-and-ipod-touch-application.html)) that's great for helping to keep a running count of calories during the day!Â  It's pretty amazing to say the lease!

So, today:

Breakfast (235) 10:30 AM

3/4 Cup Multi grain cherios (85)

1/2 Cup Skim Milk (45)

1 Banana (105)

Lunch (508) 2:15 PM

1 1/2 oz cheddar cheese (169)

5 whole grain crackers (175)

2 oz. Ham (69)

1 Sliced Apple (95)

Dinner (~1440) 7:30 PM

Naan (~440)

Indian dishes (~1000)

Snacks:

4 Dates (87)

2 pieces of baklava (336)

Exercise: 1.75 Miles (289)

Water: >64 oz

Too bad about dinner, but it was a fun dinner with Tara and Nathan :)

Still, I'm feeling pretty positive! I can do it!
