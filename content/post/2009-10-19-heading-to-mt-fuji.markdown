Checking out of our hostel at 11 AM, Tristan and I are finally leaving the first place in Japan we've come to know, and head out for Mt. Fuji. We wanted to check out earlier, but all night long people were coming in and out of our room until 5 AM. Getting quality sleep was hard.  I think these first couple nights left a bad taste in Tristan's mouth about the dormitory style hostel experience. As I warned him before, and I warn all of you now, being in a dormitory style hostel can be really hard if you're a light sleeper.  I'd suggest getting ear plugs and a face mask, and getting used to wearing them a week or so BEFORE you travel, so that once you're here, you're not forcing yourself to get used to using them.

It's interesting how in just 3 days, a place that seemed so overwhelming to you the first day, now feels rather comfortable.  You know how to get around, you're used to the sights you see as you come and go from your residence- very quickly it starts feeling like home.  I guess that's how it is for people when they move some place new.  Psychologically, you simply start getting used to things as quickly as you can, so you can feel like you have some level of consistency.

Anyhow, our Trip to Fuji is going to be far from short. Getting from Asakusa (where we were staying) to Akihabara to catch a JR train to Tokyo was simple for us at this point. However, we could've taken an express train to head "straight" there, compared to the route we ended up taking (going around the loop instead of cutting through the middle to Shinjuku). This would be our first, of several inefficient rail mistakes that we'd make. Once in Tokyo, we'd transfer to a JR that headed far, far out into the periphery of the city.  It'd be a long ride, but, taking a limited express to start allowed us to skip a good number of stops, saving us about a half hour of time.

Protip: Trains- The difference between a local, limited express, express, and super express train is analogous to how a skip-list data structure is set up. Feel free to wikipedia that.

As we took our JR train to the outskirts of the city, we were amazed at the scenery change.  There is no green anything in Tokyo. Aside from gardens and road garnishes, there's essentially no greenery. 45 minutes out of Tokyo, you're practically in a mountainous forest region! There's cute little houses tucked away on, and on top of hills all covered in trees and bushes. There are rivers, streams and ponds brushed between the valleys between the rather narrow and steep mountains. It's quite a view! Again, typical of what's shown in anime. I just didn't think it was so literal.  Everyone has tiny cars, there's really a sense of small, dispersed little villages. It was just too adorable. Eventually we made it to the end of the line, and needed to transfer to a different private railway.

Now- here's the interesting thing about private railways in Japan- they aren't just out in the country side, Tokyo itself has several private railways that constitute a subway system of sorts. Their fairs aren't transferable to one another, they literally are privately owned subways.  In Tokyo, the JR railways group has a rather extensive network of subways that connect to their various rail platforms, and through that you get something that's comparable to London's Tube system- however getting to a place like Asakusa (which is a major stop in Tokyo) requires switching to a private railway, or a longer walk from a "nearby" JR Rail.  Even getting to the airport from Asakusa was a different private rail than the rail we used to get to the JR station in Akihabara. So, when I say private railway, it doesn't mean something that looks like Amtrak; on the contrary, a private railway can be a subway, train, or otherwise, it really describes the use of the rails, not the trains themselves. JR seemed to be the biggest private railway in Japan (from what I can tell), and it, itself is the union of four different rail companies under some sort of an agreement.  Thus, the JR Pass really comes in handy when getting around Japan.

Protip: Trains- If you're only staying in Tokyo, a day JR pass for Tokyo metro trains is about $22 (¥1900), but if you want to take the Shinkansen (Bullet Train), or any of the regional trains (like going from Osaka to Kyoto or Kyoto to Nara) to go anywhere else in the country buying the JR pass before you come to Japan will pay for itself in spades.  Tickets on the bullet train are easily about $120 to $200 each way. For us, we paid $500 for a 2 week JR pass, and probably in our entire trip we will have racked up a $1000 train bill if not more.  Also, in a number of stations, bathrooms are available behind the gates, so having a pass that'll get you back to them can be rather nice! To use the pass, you simply flash it to the gate guards, and they nod you through. It's really easy. Keep in mind, you *must* buy a JR pass before coming to Japan, you cannot buy it inside the country. I think it was made to promote tourism and tourist spending across Japan.

But, back to the story- so once we made it to the very last stop of the train we were on, far out into the mountainous country side, we switched to an extremely small private rail headed for Kawaguchiko: the city we'd be staying at at the foot of Mt. Fuji.

This rail car was incredibly precious. Had a real 1970s feel to it, with a large CRT TV acting as a display screen. The Train itself was 2 cars long, made with lots of wood.  As we went further in to the country side, it was even more beautiful and amazing.  Almost every single house we saw had a small farm in it.  It was interesting that at no time did we see any huge massive, several acre fields like we have in the central valley in california, but rather, several, extremely small to moderately sized farms almost always attached to a house.  These little towns we were going through were tiny, peaceful little towns. Upon arriving at one of the stops, school had just gotten out, and 20-30 school kids between the ages of 5-10 ran on the train, in their uniforms, and all started yelling and talking and laughing- it was so amazing! No one on the trains talks at all, this was the first time we saw the silence broken! Their energy was massive, again, just like anime, with all the girls giggling, and the boys yelling.  They were on the train for all of one stop, before running off as quickly as they came, literally, passed the an old man who was the gate guard, as he was trying to check their rail passes that were tied to their backpacks- but not a single one of them stopped to wait for him to check, they just ran through the gates, off to their homes!  It was really picturesque, the whole experience of it!

The rest of our train trip there was pretty pleasant, rolling hills, and cute houses and villages. There were even some 3 and 5 story apartment buildings out in the country side.  Despite the fact that there was a lot of free space, I suppose the lack of long stretches of flat land still requires some efficient use of space.

About half way there we started catching glimpses of Mt. Fuji on the train, way out in the distance.  It was huge! But when we finally we arrive at the end of the line, in Kawaguchiko, I really couldn't believe how big it was.  I remember telling Tristan "eh, if we don't see Mt. Fuji it's not a big deal.  It's just a mountain, and we could climb other mountains while we're there." But now, after seeing it, climbing it or not, it was really amazing to see, and really a sight that can't compare to anything else.

Fuji at the Train Station. Got to love the Fuji Painted train right in front of it.

It was hilarious, the station was all done up in Swiss Alps style decoration.  In side the station there was a plaque explaining that the station is a replica of one at the Matterhorn in Switzerland.  Oh Strange Japanese Euro-fetish~

We went to the Tourist information desk and asked where our Hostel was.  According to the website our Hostel was supposed to be a short, 3 minute walk from the train station- but in Asakusa our hostile was supposed to be a short 7 minute walk from the train station, and since that was incredibly hard to find without directions from a local, we decided that we better ask right away.  So we walked in and said "Youth Hostel" without naming the place we were staying.  The agent pulled up a map, and pointed to a dot that said "youth hostile" in English. Hrm. It was about 3 blocks away.  Well, maybe it was a bit more than 3 minutes… or maybe we read it wrong and it was a 3 minute cab drive, which the agent said should be a 15 minute walk.  Ah well, it didn't look too far on the map, we can probably walk it.

Protip: Maps- Not a single map we've come across in Japan has been to scale. This map was no exception. If a map includes a scale, it's just kidding.

We gathered our things and set out, noting on the map, that if we made it to the "Bell Market" we've gone too far.  Outside the station we saw some cute little shops, and a nice view of some other mountains behind us.  There were a huge number of cabs looking for work, and the station also seemed to be the hub of a number of busses. Pretty nice, considering we're staying so close to the station, I thought.  I also saw a cafe that said "free internet" in the window.  Awesome!

We set out on what we thought would be a 15 minute walk, and found quite the 35 minute trek in which we ended up at our gone-too-far point, without even seeing anything that looked like a hostel.  We switched sides of the streets, thinking that we may have passed it on the otherside. Now, a 35 minute walk isn't a big deal, but we're carrying roughly 60 pounds of gear with us. It's not an easy walk in the park.

Heading back on the other side of the street, a tiny little icon catches my eye.  It's about 10" x 10" on a sign that's almost completely faded.  It's the Youth Hostel symbol! Hooray, we found our hostel! But… it looks completely deserted…  It's all gravel and dirt around the hostel entrance, where there's a sliding glass door, and no lights on inside. Nor tables. Nor any signs of life.  Tristan unloads at the bench infront of the hostel, and I slowly open the door to the unlit room (and it's dark enough inside that some light would be required), "sumimasen!" I call out.  No answer. I look down, and there are 2 pairs of shoes in the entry way placed neatly together.  To my right there's what would appear to be a check in desk, but it's mostly empty, with only a couple knick knacks and some dust.  I pull my head out, close the door, and turn around to Tristan, and say, "I don't think anyone is here… it's totally empty inside."  We stand for a minute and talk about what to do, and then he sees someone through the glass door moving around behind me. I turn around, and there's a grandmother there, looking at us.  I poke my head in and say, "Hostel?" She says something I don't really understand… so I say "Hostel?" again, and she replies, "Interneto" and points south on the road (the direction toward that Bell Market). I nod, and walk back outside.  Creepy. She was just standing there in the dark, looking at us like we were nuts.  I checked the sign outside again- yep, it's the youth Hostel symbol. We look around for another entrance, nope, that was clearly the hostel building. We didn't mistake another one for it.

Arg.  We're both really tired, but clearly we've made some sort of mistake.  We decide to head back to the station and ask the Tourist information for more help.  There are a ton of cabs there, so we can always take one back if that's where we should go.  We start walking back, and get right about 30 yards away. Again, I see that "Free Internet" sign on the cafe. Then I notice another really tiny, really faded sign that says, "Kawaguchi-ko Station Inn"  AHHHH, That was our hostel! And it's literally across the street from the Train station.  It was a 30 second walk away! Gahhh!!  At least we finally found it!

We went inside, and checked in.  Since Tristan wasn't too keen on the whole dorm thing, and wanted a night of quality sleep, we booked a 7 person dorm for the first night (since that was all that was available), and got a single twin room for the second night, that was traditional Japanese style (where you sleep on mats on the floor).  I wanted to go to the bathroom, I headed to the top floor, where our host said the bathroom was.  I was surprised to find that our hostel was also equipped with an Onsen (hot spring) on the top floor, from which you had a beautiful view of Mt. Fuji, unobstructed by power lines, framed by the window sill- however, there was no toilet.  Then realized when he said bathroom, he literally meant "bath"  + "room."  While I was up there, I saw a woman of latin descent, briefly said hello- it seemed she was poking around too, and I went back downstairs to find the toilet (which was just outside our room).

Protip: Bathroom- If you need one, just walk around and say "Toy-re" someone will tell you where one is.

We dropped off our stuff, and noticed that one other person had already checked into our room. Guess we'll meet them later.  With the exception of the one woman I met, everyone was totally gone. Of course, enjoying their day around the mountain. "Hrm, maybe it'll only be the three of us in that 7 person room," I thought. "How great would that be?"

Since leaving at 11, and not arriving until about 4:30, we were pretty hungry.  We decided to go get dinner, then we'd figure out what to do. The sun was setting pretty quick, and we were both still rather jetlagged, so we could still feel the tiredness coming on (since it was almost 1 AM our time).  We walked a short distance outside of our inn (to which that cafe that said free internet belonged to), and passed by a few restaurants.  We saw one that had some meal sets that we found acceptable (I was really sick of udon and soba by this point) and went inside to have dinner.

The place was totally empty, so they were more than excited that we were there. After placing our order, we sat and talked for a minute or so before  one of the proprietors beaconed us over to wall that had a small passage in to a dark room.  He said, "Museum", and showed us in to a room that had about 15 or so stunning pictures on display, very cleanly on LCD picture frames.  Nice! We thought, something to look at before dinner.  The pictures they had of the mountain were stunning.  Many of them taken in view of spring and summer, when flowers were in beautiful bloom with the mountain behind them.  It really looked quite amazing, and worth coming back to see in nicer months.  After enjoying the photographs, we sat back down and enjoyed our dinner.  It really is amazing how so little food, in comparison to american standards can really, really fill you up. I'm hoping I can stop eating as much when I get home after the 2 weeks of this meal adjustment. After our meal, we ordered some tea, and I bought some lavender butter cookies for dessert (they had little bags on the table), which were rather delicious.  Tristan was excited that they brought out english styled Tea (I have to say, green tea is all right, but it's not my cup of tea *ba-dump-tsch*).

By the time we were done with our meal, the sun had completely gone down. The town seemed really small, and we didn't really know where to go, so we headed back to the hostel to unwind, and see what we would end up doing tomorrow. On our way out, we saw that the cafe was labeled Fuji Photo Musuem cafe- which implied that the tiny room of photos next to the cafe was indeed the Fuji Photo Museum.  Heh, now we can say we went to at least one museum on our trip.

Upon returning to our room, we saw that two of our roommates were there, and one of them was the latin woman I had met earlier that afternoon.  We made our hello's and the small talk started (a pattern you get used to after a while looking something like: "how long have you been here, where are you from, what have you seen, how long are you staying, where are you going?"), but as we got going, the energy level just started getting higher  higher.  Tristan, I and the Latin lady named Duilia (said like Julia but more "duwellia" instead of a "jewelia" sound, who is from Zurich, Switzerland, but is Venezuelan by birth (and, despite living in Switzerland for 10 years, still had quite the spanish accent)) had all arrived here today, from Tokyo, our other roommate Jen arrived yesterday, but we all started in Tokyo on the same day!  Jen (who is from Canada and works for Air Canada (and only paid $60 to come to Japan!), from your favorite province, Ryan, Quebec! and no, it wasn't the same Jen) even stayed in the same Hostel we did in Asakusa, and we never ran into her! (Apparently she stayed in the basement, and really hated it because of all the noise from above). We were having a *great* time talking, relating our stories, and Duilia gave us some great recommendations for things to see.  She told us we only really needed to spend 1 day in Nara, and just do a day trip from Kyoto, and skip Osaka all together. Her travel agent friend said there's nothing to see in Osaka, it's just a big city. She also recommended some other sites for us to check out in Tokyo. We talked about how happy we were that it was just the 4 of us in the room, and then someone mentioned that they hadn't gotten much sleep the night before because someone was snoring.  "Uh oh!" I thought.  I told them I snore, but if they wanna just nudge me, I usually stop.  She said if I was snoring, I might wake up with a black eye =X.  Haha, but she was just kidding :)

After the talking died down a bit, we decided relocate downstairs but only after Tristan and I gave the onsen a try.  We said we'd meet em in a half hour.

So Tristan and I went upstairs to give the onsen a go!  Fortunately, I had noticed there was a big poster upstairs explaining in several languages how to use an onsen.  You don't just jump in like a hot tub.  First, in the outer room, you take off all your clothes and/or robe (if you're in a yukata- which we received the second night in our private rooms) and place them in a box, and place the box into a cubby hole. You then, go in to the shower room, and sit down on a TINY little upside down bucket like thing.  Now, that thing that looks like a wash cloth, that you often seen characters with in onsens in anime is NOT a wash cloth (as we discovered) it's called a modesty towel for holding in front of your bits, if you feel modest (it's not required).  The towel is not a bath cloth, and is not suppose to be placed in the onsen's water.  Anyway, once your on the bucket, there'll either be a shower head on a hose, or a bucket and a spout  that you can use to fill and rise yourself.  Then there's soap for your head and body provided, you lather up while sitting on this bucket, and clean yourself thoroughly.  (There was a guy in there, and I was watching what he was doing to make sure I didn't miss a step and upset him.)  You then use the bucket or shower head to rinse yourself off again, making sure to get all the soap off so it doesn't get in the bath.  (Now, here, the guy soaped himself again… I decided I don't need to be that OCD, and the diagram outside didn't say that.)  Then you enjoy the hot water of the onsen :)

Mmmm, it felt so great! Especially after that really long walk with all those bags!  Afterward, we go up, dried off before going to the changing room, then put our clothes back on.  Really, really great.

We then went down stairs to find the girls in the lobby, heading out to 7-eleven to buy some beer so we could drink some.  We joined them, and decided once we were there to buy a bottle of sake so we could come back and play some drinking games.  I found a bottle of sake from Kawaguchiko, and we got that, since we were in the town it was brewed in, and headed back to the inn.

We headed downstairs to the "common area" which, not shown in the picture below, looked like half like a senior citizen recreation center, and half like a japanese room.  They even had Kiminos for us to try on for fun and take pictures! How nice of them!

![DSC_0007](/img/2009/10/DSC_00071-300x199.jpg)

Time for a drinking game, ah, what drinking game to play? We didn't have cards, or dice, or anything like that, so I taught them the hand slapping game I learned from those spanish guys I always mention in London.  Even with only four of us it was still pretty challenging, but particularly so for Duilia, who was definitely winning the race on drinking her beer.  She wanted to change games, because this one was too hard.  Before switching to another drinking game, I started teaching them the cup game.  They really got into it (as most non band people do :) ) and we were having fun doing that for a little bit.  Sadly, that wasn't much of a drinking game.

Down in this little rec room, all we had were 2 games that had japanese instructions, and a set of darts on a dart board.  Since we couldn't play the other two games because we didn't have a clue how, Duilia said, "I wanna play darts!" So we agreed!  We turned it to a drinking game by whom ever got the lowest score for each set drank 3 caps full of sake (we didn't have a shot glass, so it was the best we could do).  Again, Duilia wasn't too sharp at throwing darts (at least at the beginning), and she was drinking the sake too fast.  So we found our selves changing the rule that if you just drank, you drink one cap less each time, so that way we'd all have a chance to drink.

The game was a total blast! We were all hooting and hollering, having a really great time!  I even brought my laptop down and we started streaming party music, and I was dancing fairly uncontrollably.  (A week with not a single aerobics class, I had tons of pent up energy.) After we all started getting tipsy, Duilia suggested that the loser of the next round has to put on the Kimono and do a cat walk fashion show in it.  Sadly, I lost the round (No, I didn't throw it! I swear! =|), and I had to get all dressed up.  Wow then the fun really began!

The girls started getting me dressed up

and once I got all suited up, I got all into it.  Duilia and I had a little sake pouring ceremony

We talked for an hour or so after that, about traveling, and meeting people, and just the general kind of conversations you have at 2:30 AM, until we were finally tired enough to fall fast asleep.
