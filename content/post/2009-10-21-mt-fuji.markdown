I woke up Tuesday morning around 6 am to the sound of our roommate Jen packing up and leaving. She was heading back to Tokyo to head back to Canada. Only being out for a week, I guess she wanted to make sure she saw the most impressive sight in Japan.

Falling back asleep, Duilia, Tristan and I ended up getting up around 8:30.  We talked a bit about our plan for the day, and, since we were a day behind Duilia as far as sights, we were going to set off on our own and meet up back at the hostel in the evening.  

Tristan and I came out of the hostel to a quite a morning sight.  Seeing Mt. Fuji right out front door was pretty breath taking.  Unfortunately, unlike the clear and sunny day prior, clouds were starting to creep up the opposite side of the mountain. I was a little worried that our view would soon become obstructed by the clouds. As such, we went to the station to buy bus tickets to the 5th station (which is an outpost about half way up), so that we could see the view from the mountain.  

It was a great drive up, only 30 minutes to the 5th station.  As we were driving up, you could see the leaves on the trees starting to change color.  At the bottom they were mostly green, and as we travelled up the green started giving way to gold, which started showing tinges of orange as we approached the station.  It really was beautiful.  While we couldn't really enjoy the view of the mountain while on it, the views into the surrounding areas were amazing.  We could see a number of lakes, including the lake that the town we were staying in bordered, towns and cities in their entirety (including our own, which was actually much, much larger than we thought), a sprawl of forests with small breaks where onsen's were located dotted around the mountain, patches of farms, and row after row of mountains.  One picture in particular, that I had always seen, but assumed was created at the brush stroke of an artist found its way into my camera, shown below.

Despite the wonderful views, it was cold and furiously windy. Right before we had left it was sunny and warm outside. I asked Tristan if he thought I should wear shorts or go with the jeans, or even bother taking a jacket, and in the end I decided to wear the jeans and take the jacket.  On the bus, I was lamenting how hot it was, and that I should've wore shorts, but the moment we stepped off- It. Was. FREEZING! I thought I was going to freeze to death.  All at once I changed my mind about what I was wearing. I even put the gloves on, I had packed in my jacket it was so cold. I could believe that after a 30 minute drive, we could go from weather that was about 78 heading toward 85 to about 50 degrees, with a wind child that felt like a kiss of ice! The wind was so strong during some gusts, I thought it was going to blow the camera right out of my hand.

Nothing's worse than being cold, and really having to use the bathroom, so, I figured I better track that down right away. I went looking for a bathroom (since I really, really had to go- I'd been drinking a lot of water this whole trip) and was dismayed to find that not only that the bathroom was ¥100, but it wasn't even clean! It was probably the most filthy bathroom I had seen so far, even by American standards.  There were urinals literally on every inch of wall space, on all four walls going around the room. The smell was so awful it was unbelievable. If it would've been decent of me to have taken a picture, I would have.

The 5th station itself was FILLED with tourists.  There were several buses up there as well as private cars, and there were people everywhere taking pictures.  People took pictures at the shrine, from all the observation decks, of and at the Torii, and a really strange machine that was trapped in a box, playing for the tourists. The machine was rather odd, Tristan and I couldn't really figure out what it was for. There was a place to put money in the machine, but, we couldn't figure out what it did once you did.

[XXX, movie]

Sadly, I wanted to climb the mountain, even part way, but the months to climb are July and August, and we could already see snow at the top of the mountain. The odd thing was it didn't look too far to the top from where we were, and, since it was only a 30 minute drive, how far could it be?  Sadly, the road up was closed, and while you could go it on your own, no rescue crews or responsibility would be taken if anything happened to you.  Tristan didn't feel comfortable, and with this level of wind and cold, neither of us were properly geared to do a hike like this.  On a subsequent day, we came across some Australians (Surprise, surprise- everyone who spoke English was Australian) who told us that they climbed from the 1st to the 6th station in about 4 and a half hours, but the climb from the 5th to the top (10th) would take 7 hours in summer time conditions.  Yeah, there was no way we were going to do it right then and there.  Instead, we walked a path from the 5th station to the 5th station (apparently there was more than one, who knew?) We got to enjoy the really grew view from the mountain, and battle the wind a bit on the hour long walk. We could see the location of some of the stations up the mountain, and they ended up looking rather small, in such a way where you could tell the mountain was a lot higher than it looked. *Shakes fist…* one day…

After spending about two and a half hours up there, we decided to head back down and get lunch.  The great thing is, you just grab a bus ride back, and 30 minutes later, it's warm and sunny.  The great thing was that the clouds didn't come over the mountain, I suppose Mt. Fuji is big enough to be it's own weather system, and, as such, they couldn't seem to overcome it.

Getting back to the hostel, we checked into our new room. Tristan, having been wanting a peaceful nights rest wanted us to stay in a private room, and we hadn't tried a non-bunk bed, traditional Japanese style Ryokan room yet, so I picked a private room for our second night.  We got into to the room to find wall to wall tatami mats (mats made from rice straw), a small table in the center, and a hot water pot with 2 cups and tea bags.  It was cute, though empty, but traditional, all at the same time.  Our sleeping materials were located in the closet, where we found 2 large futon style mats, that unfolded (essentially a twin bed), a comforter, a pillow, and some linens.  Not too bad, though the pad looked a little thin.  I was a little concerned for my back, but I guess I'd find out how it was that night.

After checking that out, we were starving, so we walked around and found a small eatery (right across the street from the Mt. Fuji Picture Museum, heh), and sat ourselves down.  There was another couple in there that we saw leaving our hostel when we were coming in. Looks like it was lunch time for them too. Tristan and I both ordered the "local specialties," as indicated by our menus.  Tristan's was a noodle soup that was made with the local vegetables of the region, and mine was deep fried whole fish, that were likely fished out of this town's lake.  I saw later in a super market a huge bin of them, so it seemed like a staple food of the area. I also was able to try some of his soup, with the veggies (albeit without noodles). It was rather tasty for sure!  The number 1 thing I miss at this point is fruits and vegetables.  I take for granted how awesome it is that they're available in California all year round.  Most of the japanese diet seems to be starch (in the form of rice and noodles), and meat (chicken, pork, seafood). Not that there's anything wrong with this, since, you know, most of the world lives this way, but man, every time I get any food that has the slightest bit of vegetables or fruit, I'm pretty excited!  In any case, both of our dishes were very, very good :)

After paying, we saw that that couple was outside the restaurant, trying to find their way to the lake.  We quickly exchanged greetings and names, and proceeded to guide them to the lake as though we had already been there before (which we hadn't) but we had a compass (go iPhone!) and that has proven to be extremely useful. In fact, I can't think of a single time in my life where I've actually relied upon a compass so much as I have in the last 5 days! In the middle of civilization, no less!

Anyway, as it turns out, the couple was Spanish (from Spain :p) and we began sharing stories of our trip. They too had come from Tokyo, and shared all the same frustrations we did about not being able to find anything.  This started making me feel a lot more reassured: the struggle that we've been facing hasn't been ours alone, if you don't read/speak Japanese here, it's challenging to get around. We walked with them toward the lake for a bit.  They were going to walk around it, whereas Tristan and I were heading  up to a cable car that Duilia told us about. We were together for all of 20 minutes before we made our farewells! Heh, that's the fun of traveling I suppose! :)

A short walk and ¥640 later, Tristan and I took the cable car up to a small mountain overlooking both our Lake town and Mt. Fuji.  We spent a good hour  or so up there, taking tons, and tons of pictures.  The view was so amazing.  There were tons of tourists up there, and I noticed a group of three, a Japanese boy and two Japanese girls were taking pictures of each other in turn.  I figured it was pretty obvious that they wanted a picture of all of them together, but were too shy to ask the other non-japanese tourists to help them out.  I made a gesture to offer help, and they were pretty excited, so I took some pictures of them all together.  I then asked them to take pictures of Tristan and I, and then, the two girls wanted Tristan and I to take pictures with them!  It was so cute! Our first Japanese tourist picture!

After taking the pictures, one of the girls turn to me and said, "Shieh-shieh" then reeled away in embarrassment while her friend told her [what I presume was], "they're not chinese!" I laughed, and she turned around and said "Sank you!" and I smiled back at her and said "Arigato!" SO CUTE!

After that fun, we found a trail that lead to the top of the mountain we were on. We followed it up, what turned into a nice little 15 minute hike that ended at a small shrine and… not a tomb stone, but obviously a marker for someone who had passed. It was really peaceful at the top, and the sun was slowly setting.  It was so relaxing to, yet again, enjoy the view of both Mt. Fuji and the surrounding area.  It's such a great place to go to get away from everything.

We headed back down and took some more pictures.  There were statues around the observation area of a rabbit and a raccoon.  There was obviously some story being played out by the statues, and a board that seemed to tell it, but we didn't really understand it.  If anyone happens to know what's going on, let me know, but here's what it looked like:

We rang the "love bell" and took pictures with that on top of the mountain too. No idea what the story behind that was, but I tried to get some pictures of us suggesting we were in love with the Mt. :)

As the sun was setting, we took one last set of pictures from the top, and I took pictures as we came down from the cable car.  These were probably my favorite set of pictures from the whole trip.

We headed back to the hostel, and stopped at a market on the way to buy food for the next morning.  I bought some oranges and apples, bread and jam. We'd have to get up early in order to get to Kyoto in order to make it  on time for our appointment for the Imperial Palace which was at 1:30 PM. So the earliest start possible would be critical to us getting there on time.

Sadly, as we were walking back, we missed a turn and got lost! It took us a while to figure out where we were heading, but we eventually found our way back to the hostel, after another really long walk.  We headed up to the onsen, and relaxed in the bath. Thank goodness for that. We were pretty tired.  We then headed back down stairs to our room, and Tristan planned our route from Fuji to Kyoto while I made our reservations for the next 3 nights we plan to spend there.  

Ugh, not a single place could accommodate us for all three nights, so we had to make 3 different reservations at three different places.  The first night we'd be at a Ryokan (that's the japanese traditional sleep on the floor kinda place) and would cost twice as much as a normal hostel.  The second night was in a hostel on the north side of town, and the third night was in a hostel in the east side of town. Yeesh, walking all over.

We didn't end up finding Duilia that night, and the hostel seemed pretty quiet. I guess people don't really come during the middle of the week, either that, or everyone, like us, was completely exhausted. I spent the rest of the night writing to get caught up on recording what we did in Tokyo, before we both passed out in apprehension of our extremely time sensitive trek to Kyoto.
