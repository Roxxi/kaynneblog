Diablo 3 was pretty interesting. 

The title screen was nearly the same as the diablo 2 char select screen, except that the title screen was _also_ the the character select. There were 4 classes available for selection: barbarian, wizard, monk, and ... One other, which I don't remember. What was more intersting was that you could now select your gender per class, instead of being fixed. Sadly, no female model loaded for the monk I ended up selecting.

You enter the game as a monk at what looks like a diabloesque rendition of the entrance to Zul'Farrak. The familiar yellow '!' greets you floating over an npcs head who has your first quest. My first quest was to follow the road that lay before me until I reached a town that was under attack. The few npcs began bantering to provide flavor text for the quest, but I was anxious together going since I only had 20 minutes. Sadly, their voices trailed off as I moved away, so I had no idea what was going on. I thought to check my quest log, slightly disappointed to see the same quest log set up from diablo 2-though instead of having 6 fixes quests, it was more of a free form area. But, the quests were still one large square, that, when clicked on, only displayed the objective and none of the flavor text. But, no matter. I was only going to kill stuff anyhow. 

So, how did I kill stuff? Well, Diablo 3 is as much of a click-fest as it's predecessors, so it may be time for you to get those right index and middle fingers back in shape. You click to move and attack, just like before, but now you can use the tab button to fast swap a single, prepicked sideboard skill to the right mouse button's skill, giving you three 'clickable' skills. In addition, the keyboard buttons 1-5  can have skills set to them.  To use the keyboard skills you just mouse over the enemy that you want to use that skill on and hit the corresponding keyboard key.  While this isn't awkward at all- the mouse over in combination with the keystrokes works really well- it's kind of confusing remembering which abilities are bound in which places.   The noticeable effect of this mixed interface was that I ended up smashing keys frantically when in a dire situation. Still, it's better than the D2 style of right and left click only.

In the case of the Monk (though this may be true of other classes, some of his base abilities seemed to have chain effects. For instance, the ability that effectively is your "punch" explains in its tool tip that as you successively punch an enemy, the punch becomes more and more powerful, acting like combo.  Thankfully there are no combo points, and the animation of your character fighting seems to reflect him doing different moves as you rapidly use the same skill, making it appear as though there is a succession.  Though, this could just be random moves that are used, it's hard to tell when you're frantically trying to target creatures that are exploding into blood.  The 5 abilities I was able to experience as a monk were pretty interesting. Two were basic hack 'n slash, once was a defensive move that was like a quick block, the other was an area effect blindness spell, and the other was an area of effect melee move that had quite a nice graphic with it. What did it look like? Well... if you follow naurto, it was a very similar to [Neji's trump move ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YvbrnoAkU&feature=related)except that it's only 6-7 strikes. None the less it looks pretty bad ass.  I think the biggest thing to note was that this far in the monk didn't feel like a re-hash of any previous D2 classes, and definitely had a fun feel. I was excited to level up to see what his other moves would be given that these preliminary moves were pretty cool, and had nice particle effects.

Skills also seem to be acquired in the D2 manner, where in every time you level up, you can add a skill point in one of three trees. In the monks case, they were named "Monk Skill Tree 1" "Monk Skill Tree 2" and "Monk skill Tree 3", the contents of which gave no clue to what the differences of skills would be. There were only about 3-4 skills in each column with no backgrounds yet indicating any sort of linking or level requirements- probably for the sake of demo).

Your character pane was also similar to that of D2, listing either 4 or 5 critical stats that, upon leveling I wasn't able to add points to... maybe not implemented yet, it seems like there was a spot for point buttons. There are resistances yet again, but chances are, like in most games, they end up being useless.

Your Inventory sheet was just like Diablo 2 (much to my dismay). I never cared for the "an item takes up a fixed amount of space in your backpack" and much more preferred the wow method of "every item takes up exactly one slot."  It did seem that your backpack was bigger- however not by much, so it will probably still be extremely tedious to sell items and weapons in town and constantly need town portals to get back. Unfortunately since the only town I ended up seeing was under attack, there wasn't a town portal to it.

So, as I ventured along the road, in order to complete this first quest, I encountered enemies in typical Diablo fashion. As I went, enemies were in clusters, and I often had to deal with facing groups of them at a time. It was easy to become overwhelmed with the amount of enemies, so of course potions were extremely useful. Potions now restore health all at once, unlike D2 where they restored health over and interval- however, following wow, potions have what feels like a 1-2 minute cool down.  What's worse is that this cooldown is displayed in a wow like manner, with a clock-like line that goes around an icon slowly lightening it.  Unfortunately, the problem here, as in wow, is that it's difficult to see quickly how long is left until the potion becomes usable again.  Hopefully addons can come to the rescue, like they do in WoW, but considering how much simpler D2 is... I some how doubt they're going to open up for mods, so I wouldn't hold my breath for a count down timer.  

You still have the classic health and mana balls on the left and right side, respectively, to indicate how much health and mana you have. Again, numbers aren't stressed, but if you mouse over them, you can see how much health/mana you have. If not for real, perhaps just for the sake of the demo, as your mana regenerates (which it does rapidly enough between fights to not need a potion) the liquid in the sphere is bubbling to indicate to you regeneration is taking place. I thought this was a nice touch. I didn't look to see if the regeneration stops while your in combat, so I'll have to check on that tomorrow. They also did away with stamina and running vs. walking as far as I can tell- which is good, because those were a waste.

Of course, on my trip, I ultimately died.  Upon death there was a 5 second count down before you could release. Why? I don't know. I don't see why you should have to wait 5 seconds.  The upside to dying is that now instead of starting back in your town, you simply start at the entrance to the last area you entered, called a check point. (Not like a way point- there were none thus far). You also didn't have to run back to your body (thank goodness). Obviously all these death mechanics can change, but I'm calling it as it was. Hopefully the checkpoint thing will remain, as the game text seemed to acknowledge when you arrived at a check point through an announcement to you.

Enemies drop all of the standard fair that was dropped in the previous Diablo games: Grey, white, blue, and unique items, gems, scrolls, and money. I needed scrolls of Identify to identify my items, so no free lunch on that, but it seemed I only needed to identify unique items.  

Much like in WoW, you can find scrolls on the round that give you temporary buffs.  The monk himself didn't seem to have a buff, (at least none that were available to me) so I don't know if there will be a notion of group buffing or not.  It also seems that shrines are ever present, so I imagine there will be a plethora of them for random buffs.

Along the way to the town I came across a woman who was tied up and being sacrificed by some acolytes.  Saving her unlocked a side quest for me where she wanted me to go save her friends, beckoning me to follow her until she began to vomit then explode (>*.*<).  On my quest panel, a smaller square appeared below the larger one for my main quest, and it was labeled as a sub quest (this is where the free form area of the quest log that I described earlier becomes more significant).  It seems that there can be a large number of side quests and main quests in a given chapter of the game, which is kind of nice that at the beginning it's possibly blank, so you don't know what surprises may lie ahead. A nice potential for this is that various classes or characters or plays through the game could encounter various side quests, so that perhaps you can get different tellings of the stories each time you play. That's just my guess, however.

While the game seems to be fully 3D now, unfortunately there's no way to change perspective, so the game is played in that 45 degree NSEW plane. (As opposed to the full 3D /1st person of wow, or the half rotational capabilities of Starcraft 2 / Warcraft 3) You can, however, see more of what's around you, and the map is a lot better in that now a minimap is constantly displayed in the upper right, and you can bring up a larger map by hitting m, when you need to see a bigger portion of the world. While the map does contain many more details (not nearly as much as the world of warcraft minimap (i.e. no terrain features) it does indicate useful things in the area (shrines, interaction points, the path that I was following.)

All in all, it was a good experience, and it seems pretty true to it's predecessors.  The game looks far from finished, however (not NEARLY as finished as Starcraft 2 looked). Its rather pretty so far, and I'm really excited by how the fightining went with all the new moves. Tomorrow I'll try out the sorceress and the barbarian and see if they're merely rehashes, or have their game play reinvented.
