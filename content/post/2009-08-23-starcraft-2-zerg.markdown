So, I'll say upfront, I suck at Zerg in Starcraft, so it came as no surprise that I suck at Zerg in Starcraft 2. I was killed by 3 protoss zealots in the first 10 minutes and 30 seconds of my 20 minute turn. Sadly this immediately ended my turn*.

In that brief 10 mintues though, I was able to poke enough around to find something to say about it. As in Starcraft you start out with a hatchery and 3 larva and you begin by building drones. Your drones are still consumed in the creation of every building, so no change there. The creep looks awsome, far more so than before, and when it recedes  it has a pretty cool effect of slowly disappearing, instead of disappearing in large chunks. 

Upon playing this time I noticed that every units armor has a type (light, medium, and heavy), and, as such I expect there's a Warcraft 3 like paper rock scissors relationship. They also explicitly say whether they're biological or mechanical or other (though I haven't seen anything else yet).

The zerglings are adorable on the scale of murlocs, and it seems that through the use of another building that they're capable of a further mutation. 

When your hatchery is destroyed, broodlings are relaesed to help fight off enemies. They're about as potent as zerglings, and I have to say that it sucked that 10 zerglings couldn't beat 3 zealots. Ah well.

Instead of creep colonies, overlords can be used to generate creep, though I don't know if it renders them stationary. Sunken colonies and spore colonies are now direct build objects and i *think* they are able to be repositioned. Again... Had I lived... I would've tested this. What was cool was that if buildings were left on their own with no creep around them, they'd start to degenerate, which was what was supposed to happen in the original Starcraft, if you read the instruction book.

All in all it seemed like a classic Zerg experience, or, at least, my classic Zerg experience.

Ah, on top of this, one of the best new things for the hatchery/nexus/command center is you can set a default resource rally point, so all your new drones will begin that task without further commands. Love it!

*but I'm not bitter...
