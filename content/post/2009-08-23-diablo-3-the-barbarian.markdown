After the disappointing run with the Zerg in Starcraft 2, I thought I'd have a better experience back with D3.

This time I decided to give the barbarian a whirl. In D2 I remember being so sad that as my barbarian leveled, that he had the worst time keeping up with enemies. With no real ranged attacks, he couldn't fight large groups from a distance, and ended up taking a large amount of damage on the approach. I was really hoping that all of these concerns would be addressed. Unforntunately, this wasn't the case.

Our lovely barbarian starts out in he same location as the monk. Unlike the monk, however, I started out with one less skill. Out of curosity, I opened my skill tree to see a lovely textured map of all the skills as well as the title for eack subtree, which essentially mapped to fury, prot, arms. Bleh. What was worse was that most of the skills were passive abilities, not clickable actions. Waaay dissapointing. Leads me to believe that not only will barbarians be totally screwed yet again, but also that they will be as mundane to play as any warrior class ever has been. The inclusion of a tank-like spec makes me even more sad as I hope that does not indicate the need for a tank in certain encounters, particularly in multiplayer. 

Aside from that, I encountered a new side quest that was pretty interesting. In diablo 2 there were all those little bonus rooms and caves that often had a miniboss in them and some rare treasures. I encountered the same thing here except that there was a time limit, and I was instructed to loot as much as I coils before time ran out. I thougt that was a pretty fun gimmick- added the indiana jones feel to the cave, and made me feel like it was more of an event than just more of the same. In the post game survey, thy explicitly asked how players felt about that, which must mean they intend to make it prevelent throughout the game.

Additonally I ran across a journal that was marked as a lore item. Upon picking it up, a small box appeared at the bottom of my screen with a play and stop button. Upon hitting play the contents of the journal were read aloud to me, which was great to enjoy while further slaughtering my mobs.   

While I may feel down about the barbarian, there were plenty of great things abouttje game that still leave me excited about it, much more excited about it than WoW:Catalysm
