Ah, another trip, another chance to blog. 

Here we go again, this time to New York City! This time the cast call consists of Sarah Carroll and I, however she's already beat me there- getting there a day ahead of time. As for me, I'm taking my first red eye flight ever, leaving SFO at 11:15 and landing in NYC at 8:45 AM. Hopefully the combination of doing a full work out, stressing out about getting all my work stuff done, getting packed, doing errands, getting things cleaned, returned, and making sure I have enough to get by- plus a little pink pill of benedryl should be enough to put me to sleep. 

Heh as I was writing this sitting in my seat on the plane, all the power went out an everyone freaked out. I took a picture of the computers rebooting for you Tristan- virgin america uses Linux! 

It seems that not only Sarah and I are venturing to NY this weekend, my friend Eric happens to be going as well-we had a fun facebook discovery moment over it. Hopefully we'll get to meet up!!

All week long everyone has been asking me if I'm excited I'm going to NYC. Just like Japan, none of it has hit me yet. Life has been full throttle these last few weeks, and while it's been great, I've had no time to think about or plan this trip. Thank goodness Sarah has been a saint about it, and has been looking in to stuff for us. I'm confiden that even of we'll find our own adventures and have a great time. 

I just hope I don't get mugged D:
