I was watching a fairly recent episode of Naruto a few weeks ago, and one of their newest temporary characters, Sai, pretty much has no emotions. In fact, they take some time to go in to an arc explaining why he was so emotionally traumatized that they became dead to him.

The odd thing about Sai was that he said he never knew what expression to have on his face- due to the lack of emotions.  At one point, when Sakura punches him in the face, they ask him how he can smile and be such a cruel person.  He replies back, "A smile is the best way to deal with difficult situations."

When I was first doing my instructor training to become an aerobics instructor, they told us that there would be days when we would feel terrible, upset about a test, stressed because of homework, having relationship problems, or some other sort of life crisis, but that we'd still have to teach. And on those days we just had to turn on the music and smile through it.

I have to say, especially after being reminded by the Naruto episode, that when you're out, you're with people you don't know, or working with people through a really tough problem- or even when you're alone, forcing yourself to find a reason to smile, or just smiling for the sake of flexing those muscles really does make you more approachable, more calm, and more resolute to make it through a tough situation.

Just last night I was out with 5 people I didn't know at all. I listened and made conversation with them, and even though it wasn't easy all the time, I smiled through it (Especially the last hour and a half where I was really tired and couldn't barely pay attention).  I have to say it really helped me stay polite and cordial and continue to share comments, even though I wanted to be somewhere else at that point.

In taking classes, or even at work, when I make a mistake I smile. I think this is a really important habit.  It helps you remember that it's ok, that you'll do it right next time, and that you're human, we all do it! There's nothing wrong with laughing at your own mistakes.  There are days, especially in the last 3 weeks at work, I know I didn't smile all day, and I came home, I felt emotionally drained, and ready for bed.  I've noticed on the tough days, where I do remember to smile, I get off work and feel good, and ready to go on to the next thing.

I think that smiling not only makes us feel well, but also helps us maintain a positive attitude, remind us to reality check the severity of a situation, and helps us appear more open to others so that we can form connections with new people without appearing intimidating.
