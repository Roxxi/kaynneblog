Over the last month or two, I've really started pushing myself to find new interests. Whether it's new hobbies, new activities, or things I've always wanted to do. I can't say I've put my foot too far forward in to anything yet, but I'm trying to keep my ears open.

So far I've thought of



	
  * Joining Martial Arts

	
  * Joining an outdoor group (to go hiking and stuff)

	
  * Joining a musical group

	
  * Start Sewing

	
  * Take up photography

	
  * Find a yoga studio


I guess I'm a bit nervous that if I talk about trying something new, pondering it or gathering my information, someone's going to shoot me down.  Someone in particular, who, granted, does know me pretty well, has been very fast to nay say me as of late.  I'm almost afraid to mention new interests because I'm afraid of the negativity that will ensue.  I think it's hard to try to take a step in a new direction, and discouragement coming from my friends before I even try is really disheartening.  If anything, you'd think your friends would try to be more supportive of new endevours, cheering you on so that you don't get discouraged quickly, and keep pursuing new interests.  Sometimes I feel like it's the opposite, certain people are quick to say, "No, you'll buy this and never use it, or sign up and won't stick with it."  I guess I'm a little tired of hearing it.

Sure, it may be easy to say, who cares what people think, just do it if you want to do it! But that's the point! I don't know what I really want to do. I've been keeping my ears open to new things, but I haven't yet decided which to pursue (not to say I can't pursue a combination of things).  But when someone is constantly telling you, "I know how you are, you're not ever going to do something like that," it's really hard to break out your box and try something new.

Maybe I'm a little hurt that someone assumes that I'm so simple and single minded.  Maybe I'm disappointed that a person who I would think would be really encouraging only makes strides at raining on my parade.

I try to be a pretty positive person, and try to encourage others, especially when they're moving in to a new area for themselves. I remember how hard it was for me when I wanted to become an instructor. There were plenty of times when I felt like I wanted to give up, and that there was no way I could do it, but I had a wonderful person- no, wonderful people cheering me on, and that made a huge difference.

I think that it's important, when you have a friend who is trying to do something new, that you be as encouraging as you can to help them feel confident about it.  We all do things that we realize later may or may not be for us, but a good friend should be there to cheer their friends on, and help soften the realization if they don't actually enjoy it.
