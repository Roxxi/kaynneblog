I start again: another round, a new strategy. Instead of treating this as a journal for my thoughts, I want to treat this as a project space.

Project space? What does that mean?  Well, I have 4 new categories I want to clump my writing in to, namely:



	
  * Dream Board : Pictures or thoughts of things I want to do, see, be, experience, find, celebrate. Ultimately, I want to gather enough stuff to create a real dream board.  This is a daunting task to do all in one day, so I figure anytime I find something I can add it here.

	
  * Sketches: A practice of poetry, and non-narrative writing

	
  * This I Believe: A practice of writing down the things I believe in, no matter how mundane or esoteric

	
  * This I used to believe: The realizations I have that the world isn't what I thought.


I need a canvas that will do what I want, and I think that WordPress can offer me that.
