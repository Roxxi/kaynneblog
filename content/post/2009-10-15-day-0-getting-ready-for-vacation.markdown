It's 11 pm, about 13 hours before I leave for Japan, and I think there's no better time than to start recording my trip. First off, at this, the 13th hour, I still haven't packed anything, my room is a mess, and I'm tired as hell from an exhausting day trying to tie up loose ends at work. (See that Josh, **loose** ends.) Furthermore, I still need to get all of those micro-toiletries from Target, as well as an English to Japanese phrase book. I'm sure there are a million other things I'm forgetting, but for the most part, I think I have everything important.  As we all know, the mantra "Tickets, Money, Passport" is crucial for being well prepared for any trip.

I think a great way to start a trip is to thank all of the little people who helped make this possible. So, in no particular order, thank you




  
  * Matt, for letting me borrow your Macbook Air so I can manage pictures and blog while I'm there

  
  * Luis, for letting me borrow your 35 and 50 mm lenses 

  
  * Christoph, Victoria, Edison, Patrick, David Wang, and Eunice for all of the recommendations of what to see in Japan

  
  * Tristan, for putting up with all my last minute planning and shirking of responsibility, and for buying us Yen, and taking care of half of our planning

  
  * Tara for her "Point at the picture book

  
  * Gerard, for your flight tips (Sadly, nothing was available)

  
  * Mediawiki, for allowing Tristan and I to coordinate information asynchronously

  
  * Josh, for being wonderfully supportive

  
  * Little Dave, for taking me to the airport (and hopefully picking me up from it :) ) 



If I forgot anyone, I'll add you later :)

So, before I go, what am I nervous about? Well... I'm a bit nervous about a few things, namely

  
  * The mixed messages about how much english I should expect people to speak, or signs to be posted, or resources to be available. Some people and websites have suggested it's not hard to get around at all, others have said, "you're screwed." So we'll see how bad this ends up being.

   
  * I only have 3 nights of hostel bookings in Tokyo. Is that enough? Should I have already booked Kyoto? Will it be hard to make bookings on the fly? 

   
  * Should we have planned out what we were going to do (or at least where we're going to be) more? Right now we have pockets of nothing definitive to do. How hard will it be to schedule stuff? 

  
  * Will using VIsa and Amex be a problem going around to places, or will it be easy enough to find ATMs for currency? 

  
  * How hard will it be to get to the hotel from the airport? It's a 1 hour 40 minute ride on the train. Hopefully we can figure out which train is the right one.

  
  * Will I be able to set the local time on my phone? Stupid iPhone is too automagical. 



I think it'll be great going with Tristan since his positive energy will probably help me keep mine up.

Alright, now that I wrote out my worries, I think I can pack with a clearer head! Here's to hoping!
