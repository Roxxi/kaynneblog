The cataclysm demo made the diablo 3 demo appear quite evolved. The demo begins at the character creation screen where you can choose to play either a worgen or a goblin. Of course, being alliance and a fan of werewolves, I selected to play a worgen. In my fear of not having enough time to play, I gave myself a quick name, and completely over looked what classes I could choose from, and what customizations I could make. As far as I could tell, there were no class restrictions as I saw at least warriors, Druids, mages, and warlocks. Death knights? Didn't see a one. 

The most interesting part of the whole experience was entering the world. You begin in werewolf form with your head and Arms locked in stocks. Npcs are gathered around you, debating whether or not they can cure you. Finally it's decided that they'll give you a drug that's strong enough to kill a horse, but you'll probably be ok because, you know, you're awesome. You accept the drug as your first quest and you turn back in to a human. This is the longest amount of time you spend as a human, beacuse, reallly, why would you want to spend any more time looking like a human? 

On my ability bar I had all my standard level 6 warrior skills (because everyone starts out at level 6) in addition to the ability to switch forms, which has absolutely no benefit aside from watching your avatar look at each of his arms one at a time as they turn in to werewolf arms, followed by crounching down, then roaring into a werewolf (looks cool, but that's it),  The other ability is effectively a racial form of dash. Cool.

After that, every qurst is just the standard wow fare. The excitement drained out as you begin to realize that the quests don't really reveal more about how you became a werewolf. All you end up doing is fighting some endless scourge invasion (how fresh), until all of a sudden there's a tsunami that wipes everyone out. At about that moment, my 40 mintues were up, and I left to get back in line to play Starcraft 2 as Zerg.

Expect another update soon, as I'm almost there.
