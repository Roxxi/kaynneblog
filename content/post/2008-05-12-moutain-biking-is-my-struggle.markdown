This morning I went mountain biking.  At one point in our journey, we had to bike down a fire road. A very long, down hill, gravel covered, fire road.  If you've biked on gravel, you'd know that you can't break while going down hill. At all. If you brake, the tires will completely skid and you'll basically fall no matter what.

Well, now, I'm Alex, and I'm VERY afraid of going down hills- because I'm afraid of heights... and falling... and pain...  I like constantly applying my brakes to control my descent on dirt hills! So I can go really slow!  Now if I did this on gravel, it's game over. I'd skid, lose control and fall to my demise.

Today, I had to learn to trust in the bike, and myself, that if I stayed relaxed and just let the bike roll, faster than I was ready for, it would be ok. Sometimes, you just can't apply the brakes. You can't just control the situation. You can only look ahead, let it happen, let it roll, and have the strength to relax and trust yourself.

Lately, I have been struggling with this. I worry so much about the future. Experiencing a relationship, finding a house, investing my money, getting a car, improving my body, going to school... Now don't get me wrong, it can be fun to think about the future, but I shouldn't let it take over all my thoughts.  There are times when I need to relax, look ahead, and just be confident that it'll roll.

I struggled getting down that gravely hill, but in the end, I made it.  I struggled with a number of things today, but I still made it to the end of the ride.  Our camp leader told us two things today: "I think all of you surprised yourselves today," and, "You underestimate your own basic abilities." He was right on both accounts.  Whenever I was doubting myself, I was struggling with the trail.  Whenever I pushed myself to have confidence and just go, I did better than I thought I would've. Time and time again, I've worked through and made it. I need to believe in myself.

I'm taking baby steps with mountain biking, but they're baby steps in the right direction.  I hope that this lesson will stay with me for a while yet. It's one thing to learn, but another to practice.
