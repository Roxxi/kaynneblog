Once we got on the plane in Lima, LAN had yet another silly delay. Apparently one of the bathrooms wasn't working quite right, and they needed to fix it. I guess checking the plane out before you board your passengers isn't something you can take for granted when going to other countries. Thankfully, as we discovered, LAN keeps the seats in the emergency row as overflow room for delayed flights, so we got quite a bit of extra legroom, which really aided sleep. I slept all four hours from Lima to Santiago, except to wake up once to eat another bland, soggy sandwich of white on white with some extra white and, I think, ham. Our flight in Santiago was only a 2 hour wait, but, due to the delay, we had only about an hour of waiting to do- hooray!




 




After having sent Dan an email from Lima, we were anxious to find wifi that we could use to see if he had received the message. We came across a Dunkin' Donuts right next to our gate... right next to a Ruby Tuesday, (heh, they can put them in Chile but they can't put them in Southern California, sorry Mike). Using some really terrible Spanish, I bought some water and asked how to get the internet access code, suspecting they'd give it to me with my purchase.  The woman behind the counter confirmed my suspicion, and said I'd get it just for buying the water. I took the two copies of the receipt she gave me, and walked over to the group, trying to decipher which number would be the wifi code.  Every number on there that looked like it could possibly be a code failed. I gave the receipts to Dean and Tristan to see if they could figure it out, but we concluded they weren't on the receipts. I walked back to the girl, and asked her again, how to get wifi access, and she said "oops!" And wrote down a surprisingly familiar password "ddonuts01"  Hrm... I remember getting the same wifi password in New York last year... I wonder if it's the same thing everywhere? Might want to give it a try the next time you come across a Dunkin' Donuts that has wifi.




 




Anyhow, so I hopped on and checked my email- no reply. We were bummed out.  But then I saw I had a Facebook message from Clara. I signed on to Facebook to see if she had gotten my message, and immediately she started chatting with me. It didn't take long before we realized that Dan hadn't seen my email at all, and, as such, had been worried sick about us at the airport. LAN didn't tell them that we had missed our flight, they didn't look up our checkin information or names to see where we were, nor did they confirm that we hadn't made it on the flight that had continued on without us. So, as far as Dan knew, we were there, and he just didn't know where. Once Clara caught me, she was shocked when I told her we were in Santiago. "Why are you in Santiago?!" she exclaimed. Obviously for the donuts :).  She called Dan once we relayed what had happened, and let them know we were coming in later that evening.  Quickly, Clara and Dan put together a plan for us to make it from the airport by taking a bus from São Paulo to Itapeva that evening. Their friend Alexandro would pick us up, so all we had to do was find him.  And so, since I was chatting as long as I could while walking down the jet way to board the plane, we received our last instructions, and headed on to São Paulo to find someone named Alexandro with no idea what he'd look like or where he'd be.  Hooray for adventure!!




 




Getting on our third LAN flight, the tradition of LAN have silly delays was established. The pilot came on the PA once we were all loaded and announced, "sorry for the delay. This plane hasn't flown yet today, so we need to do all of the technical checks to make sure it's ready."  Oh reaaallly? I guess it makes sense to load everyone on the plane and THEN make sure it works.  30 minutes later our plane was passable, and we were finally able to depart.
