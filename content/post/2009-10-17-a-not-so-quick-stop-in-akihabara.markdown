After getting off the Subway in Akihabara, we needed to switch to the JR trains to get to Shinjuku. Now, this doesn't sound very difficult, does it?  Most major cities I've been in tend to have 1 Train service, 1 Subway service, 1 Bus service, etc.  Sure, SF has Cal Train and Bart, and Muni... buy they're pretty distinct, and don't have much variation in the service (except for Muni- but at least all the complexity is contained in Muni).  It seems here, in Tokyo, there's the TX (what that stands for I don't know... maybe Tokyo eXpress), and there's the JR (Japan Rail) which I kind of expected to be like Cal Train- maybe one or two stops, not very sprawling, etc.  But the JR and the TX BOTH have multiple sprawling lines all over the place.  On top of that, there are other private rails that operate across certain sections of the city.  As such, there's rarely one way to get to any place, and further more, any one way to get anywhere is far from obvious.  Couple this with the fact that the map is so large, that finding anything on a line anywhere takes a good 15 minutes on it's own- then you have to compare between the JR and TX maps and see if they have similar stations so transfer at. C-O-N-F-U-S-I-N-G.

But! The good news was that our cohorts knew exactly where we needed to go- and it wasn't that many stops out! Akihabara is a medium sized hub (compared to Tokyo and Shinjuku- at least in my perception), so it seemed pretty straight forward!  The only problem was we needed to find a place to buy JR day passes for Alex and Max.  Since Tristan and I bought JR passes, we never needed to buy tickets for the JR (which was nice- too bad the passes cost an arm and a leg). What seemed like a simple task, took upwards of 45 minutes.

We first went to the JR attendent who monitors the gate (presumably so people with JR passes could flash them and he'd allow them through).  We tried to ask him where to buy day passes.  Sadly, our sign language wasn't quite up to par yet, and we had a hard time understanding where to go. It seemed like he was telling us to go over to the ticket machine- but the ticket machine didn't seem to sell day passes.  We wandered outside of the station and kept looking around.

While wandering around I saw a very refreshing picture for UFC that was a stark contrast to every asian person I'd seen in the last 2 days:

We ran into a crier for an Indian restaurant outside- who the first ethnic, non tourist, real live indian person we saw, and, being as such, spoke English! We tried asking him where to go, but he didn't seem to know where the office that sold the day passes was.  We had a good time chatting with him though, and he even spoke some Japanese with an indian accent to us.  Alex really has a knack for talking to strangers, and being rather charming, and he was a great help to us eating for these first two days, as well as getting around.

Ok, now with resolution to get some answers out of the JR gate attendant, I whipped out Tristan's handy dandy phrase book (which I've been keeping in my clutches since day one), and looked up how to say "One day pass."  Now, this book is missing a lot of words. Definitely has a ton of phrases, but not really much of a dictionary.  I didn't think the phrase "one day pass" would be in there- but sure enough it was! Woohoo! Back to the office to say--- whatever the heck the phrase was! And bingo, the guy understood what we wanted (because Alex's attempts at speaking English really slowly and loudly weren't working out too well), and showed us on the map how to get to the office. Hooray!  It was just across the street, down a long hallway of shops, and completely out of view of the rain station. -_-* Why would they put it there? No matter... 30 minutes later, we were finally going to get these tickets.

On our way, walking through the small tunnel of shops, Alex say a Juice stand, and was rather thirsty.  He went and ordered a Super Large Cup of juice (this being the biggest size of three sizes- which cost nearly $4).  He was pretty upset to see that the cup was barely bigger than his hand =/

Next door, I saw a donut place that looked rather stylish!

They even had iPhones for sale! I was so tempted to get one... if only they were unlocked all over!

But all these distractions aside, we were able to get our tickets, and push forward to catch our JR train to Shinjuku.
