For the filling:



	
  * 500 grams ground beef

	
  * 100 grams onions diced

	
  * 125 grams butter oil 

	
  * 2-3 grams of allspice

	
  * 20 grams of salt

	
  * 1 cup pines nuts




Fry the onions in a skillet, brown the meat and spices, add the pine nuts, and set aside to completely cool.

For the crust:


  * 1 kilogram Ground beef, very very finely ground, with no fat


  * 525g bulgur #1 (#1 means finest grain) (cracked boiled wheat), soaked for 30 minutes to an hour.



  * 125 grams of onions minced


  * 45g of salt


  * 5 allspice /cinnamon



Mixed everything for the crust together either by hand, or, preferably, with a mixer.

Coat the pan with cooking spray,
Make patties with the dough and cover the bottom of the pan, and smooth it out. You can use a little bit of water on your hands to help smooth it.
Put the stuffing on top of the dough, then creating patties again, put the top layer of crust on, again, making patties. 
Melt half a stick of butter, and spoon it over the top, and wipe it around.

Cut the pieces out before baking. Using a knife make crisscross patterns across the top, alternating perpendicular and diagonal piece by piece. 

Cover with foil.

Bake it at 375 for an hour, then uncover it and broil it for 3-5 minutes.

This makes 2 large pans worth. Half the recipe for 1 pan
