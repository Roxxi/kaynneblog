This morning we got up, and started getting ready for our day. As I came down stairs to meet Tristan, and offload some pictures from my camera, I saw that he made a new acquaintance of a guy named Tyson, a chinese-german guy by heritage, who is a 3rd generation Canadian. He just got to Hiroshima last night, like we did, so I invited him to come touring with us in the morning.



As we set out for our tour, we found out that he's a chef at the Hyatt in Vancouver, only 21, getting his degree in hotel management, and has a culinary arts degree too. He's visiting about the same amount of time we are, but, traveling alone, he's learning more Japanese than we are, heh.

We went to the Museum at Peace Memorial Park! Wow… depressing, and scary, and amazing.  Seeing so much footage, getting to read real documents about the bomb being dropped from the US government, seeing interviews with survivors, learning about the devastating effects of the radiation, how the bomb explodes, touching tiles, and seeing artifacts and remains that people found of their loved ones and families… it was all so over whelming.  We easily spent 3 hours going through the museum, reading every sign and plaque, looking at everything in there.  It really was a lot.

In the park, every monument is either a dedication to someone or a group of people who died from the bomb, a memorial dedicated to peace, a memorial dedicated to people or someone who helped relieve or rebuild hiroshima, a memorial to dedicated to peace, a memorial to someone who died from after effects of the bomb, or a memorial to peace.  Almost everything is the da-da-da Peace da-da-da.  While it may seem mundane, each site is pretty nice, immaculately groomed, and constantly refreshed with offerings.  It really shows that even now, so many years later, how much people are dedicated to the cause.  It really is a very nice park, and taking the time to check out almost every memorial is certainly worth it.

We then headed out for lunch, where we had Hiroshima style Okonomiyaki, which apparently totally different form Tokyo/Osaka style. Holy crap it was good.  Instead of being like an omelet, it's more like a crepe with noodles, and meat and vegetables and egg! It was huge, and filling! We took some pictures! Totally amazing! It's one of Hiroshima's specialities as indicated by the tour guides we found.

We then headed for the ferry to Miyajima, to see the Torii gate in the ocean.  We took the JR down from Hiroshima to Miyajima, which is about 25 minutes, and found out that the Ferry is free with a JR pass! Totally awesome!

We went over to the island to discover it's completely over run with deer, just like Nara- but unlike Nara, you're not supposed to feed the deer (or pet them or anything). I guess they're having population control problems, and the deer are becoming a hazard because of cars and what not on the island.  As such, they encourage people not to interact with them- but they're soo cute! We couldn't help but gawk at them(just like every other person we saw).

We took pictures of the Torii gate, and wandered around the peaceful island. It was an hour before sunset when we arrived, and it was just beautiful!  The island is extremely large (we're hoping to find a hiking trail tomorrow, changing our plans yet again), and just totally beautiful!

After the sun went down, we took the JR back to the hostel so we could drop off our stuff and find dinner.  Tyson found a new roommate in his room, Matias, who is from Italy.  We invited him to come to dinner with us, although he didn't speak much english.

We took the street car back down town, and wandered around looking for food. (If you come to japan, you'll spending a lot of time doing this since you can't read any signs to know what places serve.)  I was saying I really wanted to find a Korean BBQ place, but I had no idea how to say that in Japanese, and I had no idea how to find one. We wandered around from place to place for about 20 minutes before stumbling across a Korean BBQ place at random! Woohoo! I was finally going to get to try it!

We ordered 4 beers and a plate of meat and veggies, and a bowl of rice for each of us! It was totally great! Just like hotpot but with far less veggies, and we had lemon juice, and a teriyaki dipping sauce for the food. It was super delicious!

We learned that our Italian friend was really Argentinian, and, while his parents lived in Italy, the rest of his family was in Argentina.  He had spent the last 5 months in Australia working hard labor jobs, including working in a watermelon patch, picking melons.  Now he came to Japan for 3 weeks before heading to Argentina to stay there for another 5 months to find work and visit the rest of his family.  Seems kinda awesome to roam like that.

After dinner, Tyson wanted us to try some Umesho (Plum wine) so we headed to a 7-eleven to buy a bottle.  As we found out, you can drink in the streets in Japan! The 4 of us shared the bottle and got a little bit tipsy, as we wandered around looking for a club/bar so we could pick up some girls.  (You know me, I love the wi-mens!)  After wandering for the better part of 40 minutes, every bar we found was totally dead- I guess being monday night totally takes the wind out of people's sails. Well, it WAS only 9:30.  So we headed to a small park to kill some time, waiting for it to get a bit later.  We kept trying to pick up some girls (though it was mostly Tyson and our Italiano friend, since I'm a queer, and Tristan was tired- though we tried to play good wingmen) with no luck.  They were extremely cute, but it looked like if they weren't for hire, they weren't interested at all. It didn't help we were all dressed super casually. We probably looked unemployed in their eyes.  Also, not having a phrase book on us to look up small talk to prepare for a non-english awkward conversation proved to be quite an impediment.

I kept encouraging them to try it out on the weekend, and not worry, it was just monday night, but Mr. Italiano was ready to get laid immediately.  Eventually, I gracefully bowed Tristan and I out (in this period, we had 3 beers, and a 1/4 bottle of plum wine and were pretty tired!).

We split up, hoping to see them for the hike tomorrow, and headed back to catch a street car to the Hiroshima station so we could return to the Hostel.  Once we got off the street car (a good 40 minutes later). We were walking the very short 300 meters to our hostel from the station, when a cop car pulled over, and two polices offers got out and greeted us.  They didn't seem upset, even though they pulled over rather abruptly, and asked us questions about where we were going, where we came from, what we were doing in japan, how long we've been here, how long we were staying, how long we were staying in Hiroshima, where we were going next, and so on and so on. They then explained that they were trying to control dangerous items and asked if we wouldn't mind emptying our pockets.  We obviously had nothing to hide, so we did, and as they went through it they made small talk with us. They asked what we did and where we were from, and the cop that was talking to me was all excited that I was from San Francisco.  After they found nothing, they bid us farewell!  It was all really strange because they were extremely friendly! I mean, yeah, they totally interrogated and searched us, but they were so nice about it. They apologized for feeling up our pockets to see if they were empty, they were very kind, lots of smiles, very gentile language. It was really kinda of fun. It felt more like making two new friends, than the typical US, high and mighty, too big for my britches, high way cop that already thinks you're a piece of shit before he even stops you for anything. It was fun. We even thanked them after they searched us and gave them a good evening. I have to say, Japan has felt incredibly safe the whole time, I felt like I owed it to them to thank them for their hard working in keeping it safe, and I even told them as we were being searched (while they were trying to be as non offensive as possible), that I really appreciate how safe Japan is, and I'm more than happy to do as they ask because it's really great here. I would *never* feel that way with a cop in the US- and not feel like I was rationalizing them pulling me over, anyway.
