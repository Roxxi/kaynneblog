And so it begins again! Tristan and I are off to brazil for Dan Lorca's wedding. Sadly there's no menu on this flight for me to take a picture of, like there was for Japan, but I can still get a picture of us.

This time we also have a few guest stars- Dan's third mother, Betty, and one of Dan's friend from school, Dean.
they're sitting somewhere behind us.

Last night was a flurry of getting things done before leaving. Trying to find a new dress shirt and failing, getting some shorts, some last minute moving, unpacking, packing, cleaning, seeing Jake- I didn't get into bed until 4:40 this morning, only to wake up at 8:00 to go.  The usual travel dance.

Arriving at the airport, the most notable thing was the Japanese tour group that was in line ahead of us. 30 elderly Japanese people with an adorable tiny little tour guide. While it wad neat to see them, they took an hour to get checked in -_-*

After that and the massive security line, we had about 20 minutes to kill before boarding time. I walked around a bit to find a neck pillow and found a "build your own emaciated pug" kit. [picture to come]. Kinda frightening, but very Gerard.

Well, it's about time to take off!! Bon Voyage! (Can I say that since I'm leaving?)

Update! Our movie selection is awesome! It's kind of a funny story, Megamind, Mamma Mia, Die Hard 4, and, the all time classic, Barbie in a mermaid tale!!
