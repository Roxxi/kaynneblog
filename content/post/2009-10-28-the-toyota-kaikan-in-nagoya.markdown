The Toyota Museum and factory tour is freaking awesome!!!

Last night, after our long day hiking Miyajima, we headed for Nagoya to, once again, become hopelessly lost looking for our Hostel.  This time, we had 20 minutes once we got off the train to check in to our hostel.  We didn't give notice that we'd be late, and our hostel check in period ended at 9.  We thought we'd make it with plenty of time to spare, but, unfortunately, things didn't go quite as planned, and we wound up about an hour behind where we thought we'd be.

Our divine moment of providence struck us while walking past Chukyo University, and all of a sudden my phone made the email jingle! Wifi! We were saved! Sort of!  It was 9:04 PM, 4 minutes after check-in, but I was able to shoot an email off to the hostel to let them know we were coming, and asking them to please wait for us.  From there, we were able to get a map of the area on my phone, and were finally able to find the hostel around 9:20.  Luckily the girl who was running the desk saw our email and waited for us!  *sigh* We were so exhausted after the full day of hiking, we really didn't think we were going to make it.

Nagoya is yet another big city. It's really amazing at the sheer number of big cities that Japan has.  I mean, for us on the west coast, it doesn't seem like we have nearly the number of large cities that Japan has in an area the size of California.  Nagoya itself is nothing special. There are no special tourist sites, nothing really of too much interest, except for the fact that this is where Toyota was founded, and the Toyota HQ is.  But seriously, Nagoya feels really odd.  It's a lot dirtier feeling than the other cities we've been in.  Now, I could be totally wrong, but getting off the train and having rather pushy people force leaflets for massages by sexy girls feels just a tad bit skeezier than the rest of the cities I've seen.  But who knows, maybe our hostel was just in a more mature district than others.  Regardless, it was as clean and safe as the rest of the places we've been... but still *something* about it bothers me.

Protip: You have to book a Toyota Kaikan Factory Tour no less than 3 days in advance. Do not wait till the last minute. This really threw off our plans by about a day.Â  You can apply for the tour online, just google Toyota Kaikan (there's a link to view it all in English)

Despite how challenging our evening was, we were far more worried about the trip to Toyota Kaikan.  I spent 2 nights reading about how to get from central Nagoya (where we were staying) out to the HQ.  There were 3 or 4 different routes outlined, all of which took between 1.5 to 2 hours +/- waiting for trains or buses.  We *had* to be at the museum at 10:30 AM to make our tour, otherwise, the whole trip to Nagoya would be all for naught (really, there's nothing to see there folks).  We finally picked a route with the help of our hostel hostess, and woke up at 6:45 AM in order to give ourselves enough cushion to mess up, miss trains, be lost or not be caught off guard by a 30 minute wait time.

Protip: Give yourself 3 hours to get there! If you get there early, you can enjoy the museum before the hordes of school kids get there.

We grabbed our first train at 7:30. Luckily, it was just 2 stops to Nagoya to transfer to the line that would hopefully take us all the way to Toyotashi, the borough where the Toyota factory is located.  We were fortunate, and the train we found took us all the way there (there's only 1 of those trains an hour, the other 3 trains in the hour would leave us 8 stops away or so, forcing us to take a bus or taxi).  Once we got there, we had to switch to another train to bring us even closer to the HQ.  Luckily that was a simple matter as well.  As it turned out, it ended up taking us about 90 minutes to get there, mostly due to good luck and good timing. Unfortunately, once we got off the final train, we weren't quite sure where the HQ was.  As one would expect there were several buildings all marked Toyota, so figuring out which one was it wasn't quite straight forward.  There may have been signs, but I promise, they were all in Japanese.  We asked some guards where to go, until we found some land marks that matched out map, and suceeded in finding the museum! We got there at 10, with a half hour to spare! Woohoo!

The museum itself is awesome! It's divided in to the following sections (there are more, but most of them are like 1 exhibit that wasn't interesting- these are the big ones
  


  
  1. **Environmentally Friendly Cars**: They explain how the hybrid engines work, fuel cells, and gasoline. They have exhibits containing cut away engines, videos, and pictures showing how it all works. They also show a prototype car that weighs less than a ton (it basically just looks like Yaris with no stuffing)

  
  2. ** Safety and Mobility **: They show their various saftey technologies, as well as plans for up coming ones.  It really made me quite excited to see how much technology is advancing where this kind of equipment is becoming cheap enough for consumers to own. Most of it is sensors and cameras with recognition software- even car to car communication is exciting (at least to me) I did get the impression that Toyota cars have a good amount of saftey features (though I don't know if that's really true) but their marketing was pretty good. They could've sold me a car right there that day :P 

  
  3. ** Toyota in Society ** This was really a small exhibit, but it was a good 5 minute diorama (georama, as they call them) with moving TVs, and funny cartoon character cars (think of the Chevron car commercials with the talking cars- now give them Japanese voices)  There are four small vignettes about how Toyota cars can be used to make the world more efficient for everyone. It's pretty cute, though slightly unrealistic :) The nice part is it doesn't totally ignore the needs for other forms of mass transit.  Toyota makes a number of buses in Japan, so, they don't down play their relationship to the trains and what not. 

  
  4. ** TPS (Toyota Production System)**: an explanation of how Toyota's founders greatly improved the assembly line process that cars were made upon, and how their tactics helped turn a small, loom making company, in to a large automobile power house.  It was really very interesting to hear the history, and, when seeing the tour, it gave you a sense of appreciation of what was going on.  It really is amazing how well they all work together.

  
  5. **Show room**: Nothing more than a dealer show room, but the good news is I fit in to the new Prius!!! Also, it's pretty amazing on the inside. The dashboard is pretty sweet!!! Does a lot of neat screen overlay things!  If my car were to die, I'd seriously consider the new prius 1) because I fit, and 2) after watching them being assembled on the factory tour, I feel a bit closer to the car :P 

  
  6. **Demo Area**: In the main lobby, they demoed two pretty cool robots.  One was a robot that had artificial lungs who could play a real trumpet, really, really well. He'd go off every 45 minutes or so, and the other was a demonstration of a concept vehicle, called i-Unit they had on display in 2005 for an autoshow. The demo of it was amazing, and they video they had for it was so final fantasy, it almost made me wet myself :) 



[Here's that video! (i-unit concept video)](http://www2.toyota.co.jp/en/tech/p_mobility/i-unit/postshow_b.asx) Gotta love the music! Wheee!!! Driving underwater! It's the future!!! I love flashing lights and colors! I'm a sucker.

I recorded a demo of both, and I'm hoping to upload it soon :)

So, we spent the time before and after the tour going around the museum, playing and watching the exhibits.  The tour itself was a tour of the factory- we got to see the giant robots weld together pieces of the car (95%) of all welding is handled by giant robots, and we got to see how the cars were assembled down the assembly line.  It really was quite amazing.  With the whole TPS thing, it was really like watching a fine tuned machine how quickly cars could be assembled, with the efficiently of not having huge inventories of parts sitting around.  They even had some exercises on the tours that the employees recieved as training for us to try about how to work more efficiently. They were pretty cool :)  They were simple little games, that you had to complete in a certain amount of seconds.  One was taking different sized pegs and putting them in holes, the other was taking rope and wrapping it around pegs in a certain order and direction.  Though the games were simple, you could see how they were applicable down on the assembly line.

Some crazy guy was taking copious notes during the tour, as if he was trying to copy what was going on inside the factory.  It was rather odd, mainly because he kept pushing us out of his way as he squeezed in to look at things and make notes on his little folded piece of paper.  I dunno what he was writing, but it wasn't in English or Japanese, that's for sure.  He probably has his own production company and wants to use TPS to make things more efficient.
  
Anyhow, after all was said and done, Tristan and I made the long hour and a half trip back to Nagoya, only to discover that this morning we could've taken the JR all the way here and done the trip for free instead of paying $10 for our tickets out. D'oh!  Oh well.

We had originally planned to go to the Toyota Museums in central Nagoya (so I lied, there is *something* to see here), but sadly we didn't have enough time to make it before they closed, so off to the Shinkansen, and back to Tokyo to spend our last, full day here in Japan!

(Sorry, not many pictures today! Toyota Factory tour didn't allow any, and I was enjoying the museum too much to take pictures in there.  I'll get that video up soon!)
