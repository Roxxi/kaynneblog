Paul is working really hard to get in shape.  He's had enough and wants his body to be as amazing as he is in person. He's really inspiring me to get my rear in gear!

So what do I want to try to do? Well, 2 days a week I'm going to not only journal, but also count the calories of the food I consume and mark them during the day.  Paul suggested I use this website: http://caloriecount.about.com/   to count my calories.

Paul is doing a lot, more than I think I can do right now and be successful- but I can try! Food journaling over the last few weeks has really helped me think about what I eat during the day.  I've been working hard to cook (Just as he has!) and to pick foods that are richer in vitamins and minerals.  I know it's not all going to change over night, but I just can't let him take all the glory!

Sorry Paul, I'm going to have to make you my rival to keep me motivated.  I may be behind now.. but watch your ass, I'll catch up!  Sooner or later... sooner... or later...

(Ganbare!)
