Have you ever looked really closely at moldy bread? I mean **really** closely? The little bits of mold kind of look like small trees and bushes.  If you take a slice of the moldy bread, you can see that the mold forms a small layer of "roots" down in to the bread.

It always makes me wonder, when I'm in some high up building or in an airplane, looking down on a lush, green area- how different is our world from the mold on a piece of bread.  Are there beings that view us as a mossy rock?

It amuses me that our perception of mold- thinking of it as something gross, doesn't translate to the thinking of trees and bushes.  But then one gives us food while the other makes food undesirable.
