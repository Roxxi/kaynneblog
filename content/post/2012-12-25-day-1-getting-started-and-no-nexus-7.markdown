It's been two years since I sat down and wrote anything on here. I guess after Chile/Brazil, I never really came back. Needless to say, life got... complicated... and busy... and there was a lot going on. 
But now, under threat of shaving my head bald, I will be back here, writing again for the next... let's see December 24-31 ... that's 7 days, and the entire month of January- that's 31 days- so, for the next *38* days, I will be writing, and, seriously, if I miss a day, I have to shave all of the hair off of my head.

So, where to start? Well, there's been quite a backlog of things I've thought about writing about for a long time.  Let's start with a quick brain dump list (this is by no means a binding contract- but just incase I want to look later)

* My experience at Analytica
* Learning ruby
* Things I "learn" at work via other people
* Things in Clojure
* Ideas I have in general
* The general retelling of my days
* Essay-like points about whatever (I guess these last two things are whatever really blogs about)
* Maybe about the books I'm reading?


I felt like I was so full of ideas the other night, then all of a sudden they just ran away out of my head.  So it goes.

But, at least right now I'm writing about stuff.

Today was an interesting day. I woke up at 8, sat in bed for 3 hours playing the MLP iPhone game- just grinding and grinding and grinding- using the clock bug to constantly generate money and keep training my ponies. At one point or another, the thought crossed my mind that this is *more* tedious than grinding in WoW, and that, at the very least, I should get up and play World of Warcraft instead of playing these insipid bouncy ball or catch apple games. But no. I just laid there all morning working to knock out these obnoxious "quests" to play the bouncy ball and apple caching game as many times as I could. 

Then, at 11, I got up, and decided to open my new Kindle. I have to say I feel kind of guilty buying the new kindle. The Kindle Jake gave me is perfectly good, albeit old. Sure the screen doesn't light up, and sure it's bigger- but the new one doesn't really feel that much lighter. What's more is that the big one has 3G and for whatever reason I didn't get that on the new one- although I don't really know that I need it yet since I have only *once* bought a book over 3G? I figure I can always find a starbucks should that really be a problem.  But it does seem a bit wasteful. I mean, I had a _free_ kindle... it's not like I needed another one. I guess I did want one with a smaller form factor- and I guess with the new job I wanted to feel like I got a new toy.  

Originally I didn't even consider getting a new kindle. I was in the market for a tablet. I looked at the Nexus 7, the kindle fire, the iPad Mini and the Microsoft Surface. To be perfectly blunt- they were all almost good enough to be useful- but they all had such annoying short comings.  The Nexus 7 was made by asus- whose hardware is often of dubious quality. So whose to say its a good thing... more over since everything I own is in the apple ecosystem I couldn't really share my music and movies- though I don't know that that's really an issue since I'd always have my phone anyway. Most of the apps I use, which are very few, are available cross platform. So, at the end of the day it was the look and feel of Andriod that just didn't really win me over.  When I sat down to spend an hour with Bryan's Nexus 10 tablet, I just found everything too chaotic. Things were semi consistent about where menus were and where they would be. The widgets were cool, but I found myself not trained to look at them (since after years of using the iOS home screen, I'm used to nothing useful being present on the desktop) and then there were just SO MANY APPS installed on the device- and I'm pretty sure they came pre installed as part of andriod. It was just too over whelming.  It actually reminded me a LOT of windows XP- in the once you install it, you need to spend 2 hours customizing every setting and making it look exactly how you want it to look. I don't suppose you need to do that- but because you can they practically expect you to customize it to what you want it to be. I just don't want to have to care to make my device work for me. So really, at the end of the day, it just felt like the device would be too much work that I didn't want to engage in to own, and that its really better left for those people who really want to customize the look and feel of their tablet.
