Well, after making it to the hostel Sarah and I got going pretty quick. As it turns out, she was super hung over since Holly and her went out drinking the night before.

We grabbed some breakfast from Dunken Donuts *check*, then went back to the Hostel so she could change, while I started reading up on what to do.

Without going in to too much detail, since I was extremely tired we:




	
  1. Went to the Gugenheim

	
  2. Went to Rockefeller center and met Kat

	
  3. We to Magnolia's and got Cupcakes (that was the place referenced in Sex in the city *check*

	
  4. Met up with Dick and played pool in Korean town
