I think it's important to remember that a lot of things in our day to day life, that we take for granted, are completely silly.  For instance, I think the whole notion of what's acceptable to wear at work, to a party, to a club, to a ball, to the gym, to a wedding- etc, is completely arbitrary.  It's a completely learned notion about what's acceptable, but there really is no real substantial reason why you can't wear a swim suit to a wedding.  The only requirement seems to be that you should have enough material to cover your no-no parts.  That's the only thing that's relatively consistent about what to wear.

You may argue that how we dress is how we express ourselves, so that we can feel unique- but then the whole point of dressing is to cover up our differences (once again, our no-no parts) so we look more the same. Not to mention, we tend to buy clothes because some marketing machine has taught us to, and we merely follow what we're shown.

But then, what about colors? Women can wear whatever they want (provided they have long hair, as to not look too "dike-ish") but men are so painfully restricted (once again) completely arbitrarily.  Why are pink and purple girly colors? Flowers don't really have a single gender.  Royalty used to be always associated with purple.

What about accessories? Girls can adorn themselves with anything and everything, but men? Well, I can't go around wearing a head scarf with out it being assumed I'm part of a gang.  I can't wear head bands without strange looks, I can't wear braclets, bracers, or jeweled rings, colored sox, shoes, waist ties, anything flowing, capes, cloaks, anything.

Now I know you're going to say I can do anything I want. I'll just be mocked.  But my point is I shouldn't be mocked! It's completely arbitrary to have these rules!

I suppose because we seek to live in groups and seek identify with one another, that's why we conform- especially with our appearances.   There's nothing wrong with that, it's part of our humanity.  I just think that being more aware and understanding of those that do try to step out, do try to wear things that they enjoy regardless of what those around them say, should be shown some praise and kind smiles, rather than scornful grins or mocking glances.

So why Silly Hats Only? Because we're humans. We're silly, and sometimes, it's just plain fun to wear a silly hat, laugh at ourselves for thinking it's silly in the first place, and share it's fun with those around us.
