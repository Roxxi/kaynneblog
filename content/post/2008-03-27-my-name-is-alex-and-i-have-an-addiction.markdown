All I'm doing at work right now is writing! Write, write, write, write write! Not that I don't like writing, but I want to do something more mentally stimulating.  But for the sake of future generations, I MUST PERSEVERE!

This weekend I'm looking forward to doing a mountain biking lesson.  I'm dropping a ton of cash to do it, but I really want to find more ways to get outside.  There are worse things I could be spending my money on, right?  Why would I need a lesson to go mountain biking? Eh, I don't really, I just need a group of people to go with.  I made it through college without paying for friends (yay for Band being free), but it seems like now I gotta shell out the dough to get out and about in the world.

I constantly struggle with being motivated to do things alone. If I'm alone, all I need/intend to do are things like surf the internet, watch anime, or play video games- and even video games I have a hard time doing alone.  I had a thought the other night: "Am I addicted to being with other people?"

Now, I do know that often I need alone time. I need days to sit and recharge, and have some peace and independence.  After a few non-stop trips across states in a van with soon-to-be 9 of your closest friends, I know that I will need time away after prolonged exposure to people.  However, I do feel that whenever I leave my house, I would rather be doing anything, from errands to recreation, with people.

Going to bars intimidates me. The thought of standing there not talking to anyone... I'm not even sure I'd know what to say.  I'm not used to receiving complements from strangers, I hardly ever know how to react, and I typically say the wrong thing.

It's so aggravating.
