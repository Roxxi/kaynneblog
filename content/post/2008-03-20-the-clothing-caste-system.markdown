My first post talked about how it's silly they we have certain uniforms for various activity.  I was at Costco today, and it wasn't the first time I noticed that everyone who works there wears whatever clothes they like. Honestly, I feel like Costco doesn't demean their employees by making them wear a "team outfit" like other stores to.  I always feel like the people working there are just normal people, like you and me, and that I, myself, am part of something bigger. I don't feel like I'm being served by those people, so much as just being there with them.  It's hard to explain, but I think it has a different air about it.

But that kind of makes me wonder, do stores dress their employees to promote a team spirit, or does it help separate them from the management.  Anyone who has worked a uniformed part time job probably has seen some training video or slogan along the lines of "Take pride in your uniform." But as you rise up, what you can wear becomes less and less uniform.  Usually managers can wear what they like- sure it has to be styled up a bit, but often they're allowed more freedom.

A few weeks ago, I noticed that one of the desk boys at the gym who usually checks me in every morning wasn't wearing his standard Equinox black T-shirt and black pants. Instead he was wearing a nice dress shirt that was quite colorful, a tie, and looked pretty refreshed. I noticed on his tag it now said, "Front Desk manager."  So, as a front desk lackey (for lack of a better term) he was forced to wear the "team garb" and once he became a manager, he was allowed to stand out a bit. Ironically you'd think you'd want him to be better dressed in the first position, since he's so client facing. But perhaps the notion of service is what drives this notion of uniformity, as if to suggest to the customer, "you see all these people here? They're here working just for you."

I guess that does have a nice feel to it when you're going to a store, or a gym, or a restaurant. But I have to say, it's nice that there's a bit of a break from that at costco.
