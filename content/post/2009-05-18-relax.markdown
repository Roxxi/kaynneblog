a gentle breeze lightly brushing your hair

some warm sunlight dancing across your skin

the air, sweet with the smell of coconut milk, and tropical flowers

a nice person who shall remain nameless is inside the hut

making you a nice meal

as you stretch your body out, like a cat

releasing the tension in all your muscles

a small butterfly floats infront of your face

you wistfully follow it, as it brings your gaze up to a clear blue sky

with some gentle puffy clouds, lulling by

you get up, and walk outside, feeling the warm sand between your toes

squishing them, feeling the graininess

you call back in to the house, to let your companion know that you're going for a dip in the lagoon

and step out, on to a small sandy path

the path is mostly sand, which small patches of cool green grass

that cools your feet, with it's dew drop covered blades

moving around a large bush, you come to a small lagoon, with a gentle waterfall that pours in to it.

looking down in to the crystal clear water, you see some colorful fish gliding around through the water

you stick your feet in, finding some cool relief from the hot sand

a gentle breeze blows through your hair, right before you jump in to the pool

creating a huge, jovial splash

the shock of the cool water surrounds your body

refreshing your spirit

you glance around, admiring the fish, before coming up for air

and float on your back a bit

looking up at the clouds

turning the shapes in to a story

purely for your own amusement

another quick dive down, and you decide to return home to enjoy a meal, that the one who shall remain nameless is cooking for you

as you near the small cottage, the sweet aroma of meat and fruit fills the air

and a smile appears on your face in anticipation.

You enter through the door, giving a joyful greeting

and the replying call back is music to your ears

your invited to sit down at the table, as a piece of roasted meat, fruits and nuts are placed before you

you eat your meal, conversing with delight with your gracious host

recalling the story you saw the in clouds earlier that afternoon

after the meal is done, you gather some wood for an evening fire

while your host cleans the dishes

then you nestle together in a hammock with a blanket over the both of you

whisperng silly and amusing things to one another

until finally the fire starts to die down, and you drift gently off to sleep

the last thing you feel

before you finally relax

is the soft touch of his hand

caressing you head

followed by a soft kiss
