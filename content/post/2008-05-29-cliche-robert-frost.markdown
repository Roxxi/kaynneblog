Recently, one of my high school friends was first to get married.  It was a great wedding, a lot of fun.  But it made me start to wonder... is this the beginning of a lot of people in my life going down a road that I just can't follow?

Don't read this as a sad or depressing post, that's not my intent.  I sincerely am curious if over the next few years, as my friends inevitably get married and settle down if our ability to relate to one another will diminish?  I won't have a wife and kids to worry about, I won't have a mortgage looming over me.  What will I talk about when we get together?  Will they really want to hear about my single life drama? Will I even want to tell them?

I sometimes wonder if we'll just drift apart. People like to surround themselves with people they can relate to, share common experiences with, and understand and be understood by.  I wonder who I will end up keeping in contact with and staying in touch with, and who I'll see few and far between.

Lately over the last month or so, I've been really forced to come to terms with my identity.  I've been starting to realize, maybe I don't know what it means to be gay, or to be me.  I gave up World of warcraft, which, as a part of MMOness, had become such a significant part of who I am/was.  But now I want something new, something more. I want to learn and see and find myself in a different way. See who I am in a world that isn't online, that isn't make believe.  Where my efforts and skilling actually does make a difference.

Lately I've just felt like I should forget everything I knew or thought, and just start over.  Not to say I'm giving up my sense or ability to think, but I need to explore who I am in ways that I previously haven't.  It's clear that I can't follow the relatively simple path of my friends, going off to start a family- well, I do want a family, but I have to discover what it having a family means for me.  I really can't say I have a clue.

I'm not ruling out any possibilities, and I fully am aware that this is a phase.  I think it's something many people go through. It's part of that general quarter-life existential crisis that we all are going through.

"Who am I, What am I doing, Where am I going, What makes me happy, Where do I fit in?"

Heh, it's all kinda funny.
