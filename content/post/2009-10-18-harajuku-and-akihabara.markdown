After leaving Shinjuku, the four of us decided to stop off at Harajuku and check that out. Harajuku is the punk-teen-trendy kinda scene, home to all the whacky, off-beat fashion in Tokyo.  Well, that certainly seemed true. Walking out from the trainstation we were presented with a river flowing with people down a rather narrow street, completely walled with clothing stores.

It had a kinda of west hollywood/sunset - irvine spectrum kind of feel, except much, much tighter.  All of the stores were small brand names, and they were all pretty cute (though mostly for girls). I particularly liked these two outfits:

Cool and Spicy

They even sold sexy lingerie (which I was pretty surprised to see, initially)

We walked down the street, enjoying the sights of all the people dressed up, there were groups of black guys at some of the shops being barkers, kind of funny hearing them speak japanese, some with carribean accents. We stood in line and had crepes, which were really good. It was just so adorable seeing all the girls all dressed up, especially since we've spent most of the day looking at uniformed businessmen, school kids, or normally dressed people. It was a breath of fresh air to see some rebelious dress spirit, and all of it just looked so cool!

After heading down that main avenue, we made it out to a main road, and along the street, we saw lots of familiar brand names, including a 2 story Godiva store, and a 3 story H&M; (reminded me of you, Eric- you should try to transfer to this one!).  But anyone brand worth mentioning was there: Louis Vutton, Tumi, Stussy (which we didn't know still existed), Quicksilver, this that and the other, and Emporio Armani!  When we came across that, Alex's eyes lit up, as they might actually have Aqua di Gio. He rushed inside, and I went with him, while Max and Tristan waited out front.  Immediately, he went to the counter and said, "Aqua di Gio," eyes all a gleem with hope! But sadly, the man behind the counter shook his head and said, "Emporio Armani, you need Gerogio Armani for that cologne." Darn! We thought we had finally found it! Ah well. Alex'll live.

Oh, I saw a vitamin water vending machine. Reminded me of my co-worker since he drinks it pretty often. It was the first time I had seen vitamin water there.

For you Alex Kim

We started walking back the way we came, figuring we saw what there was to see, until we came across "Condomania"

How can you not go in to a japanese sex store!

Sadly, the shop was filled mostly with things that you could find at Spencer's in the mall. Eh, it's great to see that they import our sexual sense of humor.

I did buy something here though, for my other roommate Jim, since, it's what he asked for... more or less...

We also came across the first bit of grafitti I've seen since being in Japan: a street sign that was covered with stickers. The stickers themselves were pretty funny.

I also saw this sign. Tell me, which one of these things doesn't belong?

(What definition of "Tout" would make sense to be forbidden here?)

Anyhow, we made it back to the train station and headed back to Akihabara, to make a transfer to head back to our hostel in Asakusa. Man, the trains were so full on some of the trips, that there was barely any room to sit, let alone stand comfortably.  It's really true, they try to pack in as many people as they can on to the trains here, and any tiny bit of space possibly available, will be used if it must be. What was more peculiar was how synchronously people seemed to occupied spaces.  For instance, if the train station was full, then the shopping centers weren't nearly as full.  If the shopping centers were full, the the trains would have space.  Maybe there is just a "certain time of day" you do certain things that we have no intuition about.  Either way, it was interesting how you could be in a place that would be full of thousands of people in one moment, and totally empty the next (or if you came back slightly later).

Once we came up from the tunnel to transfer in Akihabara, we saw the amazing night time view of the district all lit up. It was pretty overwhelming.  Max and Alex told us about a 5 floor hentai store they wanted us to see, and given that everything looked amazing at night, we figured we'd walk around (although, by this time, Tristan and I were really starting to feel tired from the jetlag.)

We wandered down the street, first to a store where Alex had found a watch with a hidden movie camera in it for about $36 bucks. I was curious to see how it worked, so we checked that out.  The camera was really low quality, and you'd have to aim the face of the watch at the subject pretty consistently- but none the less, it was pretty cool.  Alex started asking the man behind the counter if they sold the type of memory he needed for his video camera- though it seems that the man couldn't figure out what it needed- neither could we, it was pretty poorly labelled, and not obvious.

Then we left, and found a large electronics store.  It was pretty amazing- just the sheer number of choices for every kind of device, all being sold in one spot.  It'd be impossible to decide what you wanted in a store, you'd have to know what to get before coming in- there are just too many choices.  I found this *really* cool MP3 player I wanted to buy from Sony, that was brand new, but they told me it only worked with Japanese windows :( total sadness. Completely blew my shuffle out of the water

We wandered out after Alex couldn't find his memory, yet again (or maybe he found it, but wasn't willing to pay for it...) and wandered down some more.  All of a sudden, there were lots of cute girls along the street, in various maid outfits, all handing out fliers to go to their maid cafes!  That was so awesome! I wish I could read japanese manga, because if I could I would sooo gooo! They were so cute!

We saw a cardboard stand with some anime character faces cut out, so Tristan and I couldn't help but to take a picture

Not long after that, the two of us really couldn't go on anymore. It was about 8 PM, but for us, it felt like 5 AM +, so we all decided to go back to the hostel.

Once we got to the hostel, we all headed to our room to relax after a LOOONG day of walking all over the place.  After chatting for a bit, Alex pulled out his laptop and we started watching the comic Russell Peters. Freaking hilarious. Been a few years since I saw him last.  During the day, Alex and Max had told us that they were planning on hitting up a club in Rippongi that evening, and that they were going to meet and leave at 10 PM, and head back around 5 AM. "Wow, why the long night?" I asked. Well apparently the subway stops running around 11, and doesn't start again until 5- so you'd have to stay out and wait, or cab it back. I was really tempted to go, honestly. I hadn't had my zumba for the week, so my need to dance was pretty high, but I was just too tired.  I also didn't think I could maintain a "straight"* face for another 6 hours given how tired I was.  The internal conflict was rather amusing to me... "I want to go dancing... ugh feigning interest in women... It's a shame not to go out... I'm sooo tired... they're pretty fun though... 5 am is REALLY late..." Haha, it was quite the conundrum.  In the end, however, I ended up going to bed. That was the end of our Epic Saturday!


* It really hasn't been that hard keeping a straight face here. The girls are a lot cuter than the boys (don't get me wrong, it's because of their clothes and posture), so it's easy to show more interest in them, coupled with the fact I'd want to sleep with neither of them...
