This morning we woke up a bit later than we thought we would- actually, later than Sarah thought we would- I knew there was no way we'd wake up at 8 after going to bed at 2-at 10 am. We got ready and were ready for action around 11. Very cold, wet action. It was pouring!!! Ugh! Turns out our whole day was going to be filled with raging wind and torrents of cold rain falling down upon us. 

The first thing Sarah wanted to do was find a post office to mail some post cards he had bought the day before to send off to some friends. We asked for some directions and set out to mail em. Upon arriving where the post office was supposed to be, we couldn't find anything! It turned out that the post office was in a non-descript brick building that hardly had any indication that it was a post office. What a pain. 

Afterward, we saw a Jewish shawarma place and stepped inside to grab some quick sandwiches for breakfast. I went up and ordered a falafel sandwich, and the guy looked at me quizzically and said, "that's all?" I returned the expression, and said, "yeah?" I then stepped back, to let Sarah place her order, but she was still going over the menu. Eventually, she was ready to order, but ue had begun making my sandwich, and continued working on it until it was completed. He never seemed to acknowledge that Sarah wanted to place an order too, and as he was ringing me up, Sarah and I exchanged looks like- is he not going o talk to her because she's a woman? (Well, that was my expression.) She then started speaking to make her order and the guy jumped and look startled, like he hadn't noticed her (and this place was tiny, and we were the only two people in it), and said, "oh, did you want something too?" Fail. No wonder he asked me if that's all I wanted, he assumed I would be paying for her. How rude of me :-p

Anyhow, because of the torrential rain, we decided it would be a good day for a museum. We headed over to the museum of sex, which was amazing! 16 bucks to get in, but we spent a good 2.5 hours there. The museum is divided up in to three sections: condoms, syphilis, and the senseless moral battle against safe sex; sexual fetishism - toys, dolls, photography, hentai, homo eroticism, S&M;, eating (Nathan would've loved that video); and finally sex in film and porn, including celebrity porn, the evolution of sex in film, homo eroticism, classic porn, and its role in history. 

The first section was rather interesting, seeing the evolution of condoms, the materials and processes used across centuries, and how different societies regarded them. It was interesting to see how they came in and out of popularity across time, and frequently they were regarded as a best practice to prevent both pregnancy and disease prevention, and often only available to those of high status.

It was interesting that in London one woman in the late 1800's started a company making linen condoms of very high quality that she ended up selling to another woman, then that woman who bought the company drove the quality so far down that the first woman founded anohter competing condom company. 

 In the early 1900s they were available as a controlled substance- you needed a prescription to obtain them, and they had to be placed where women and children couldn't see them. In fact, women weren't even supposed to be educated about them, leaving the use of them, I suppose, as a mystery to them. 

Then during WWI, so many solider were getting VD from prostitutes that something like 18000 solider a day were out of commission from various VD that the military started issuing condoms with training instructions. Just keeps going back and forth.

Anyhow, I could go on and on about the sex museum- needless to say, it was really enjoyable and interesting. Especially watching porn with lots of people around to comment it. I finally saw the Pamela Anderson/Tommy Lee Video, and the Paris Hilton tape of her giving that guy a blow job that made her famous. I had no idea Paris Hilton wasn't famous before that video.

Afterward we started wandering over to the Fashion Institute of Technology, since it was near by and they had a free museum, too. On the way we stopped by a while sale hat store, and given all of the rain, Sarah decided she wanted to buy a hat.  So we went inside, and maaaan, I've never seen so many hats in a single store! And they were all super cheap! Too bad there were a little to ethnic looking for poor, while little Sarah, but we eventually found one that looked good on her :)

We continued on through the storm, and decided to grab a quick cup of coffee at DD right across from the FIT museum. Our quick cup of coffee turned into a half hour of sitting at the window, people watching, and chatting about various things. Around 4:45 we decided to saunter over to the museum only to find that it was closing in 15 minutes. What was in the museum? A bunch of dresses and fashion though time. It would've been interesting if we didn't only have 10 minutes to look through a couple rooms of it. Ah well. Kicked out we got!

As we were leaving we started noticing an increasing number of umbrellas discarded and broken in the street, abandoned, doubtlessly, by their owners once the fierce wind ripped them at their seams. I took a picture trying to be crying over one, in memory of mine that was destroyed the day before- but you know me, I can hardly keep a straight face.

We decided to head up to 5th Ave. To check out the glass cube Apple store. We were talking on the subway and ended up missing the stop we needed.  Sarah said we could continue on and take a quick look at Columbus circle.  We got off the subway there, went upstairs and the storm was in full furor. Sarah told me to look up and see the trump tower, and as soon as I did, a BIG guest of wind, came up, knocked the umbrella in my hand, and all the water flew off my umbrella on to my face.  Thanks, Weather, for a slap in the face.  Bleh, it was so bad, we just went straight back down to the subway and headed back to the Apple store.

Once we got there, it was still raining so hard we couldn't really take a picture- we did however marvel at the clear apple cube sitting on the corner surrounded by high rises.  It's so Apple to, in a city of high rises,  build a building that's entirely underground.  We went down, and it was HUUUGGEEEE, must've been partially under the street.  We hung out there for a while, just looking at things and keeping dry- until we decided to watch Lady Gaga's new music video for telephone. Oh. My. God. Amazing!!! Now I can say I saw a show in NY.

After that Sarah and I split up. She went to meet Kat for dinner, and I went to meet a someone I was talking to online the night before, named Kyle.  We met up at a starbucks, and sat and talked for a couple hours. He was really nice- in the airforce for 10 years, training pilots how to use their equipment, had an MBA and a degree in... I forgot what, lived all around the world, most recently in vegas, and had just moved to New York at the first of the year.  It was funny, because even though I had only been here 2 days, he was leaving picking where to go up to me, and was constantly getting lost out of the subway. It was like I was the one who'd be living here ;) Since he was really nice, I invited him to come hang out with Sarah and Kat and some of Kat's friends, as my friend Gerard said we should go to a restaurant named Lips down in the Villiage. 

So Lips is like a drag queen version of Hooters. It was amazing! All the waitresses are drag queens and maaan are they sassy. We came in because at midnight they put on a show called the "Dirty Show."  It was a lot of fun. Just about every table had a person of honor: couple of birthday girls, couple of bachelorette parties, and when they came around to our table, I told them it was my first time in NY. They did their show, incoporating all the table people in to it. Sarah took some pics, that i'll post later.  It was the usual fair- lip syncing, but smart mouthed, sarcastic and sassy- but it was tons of fun! I highly recommend it, especially if you have a birthday! They make you get on your knees and eat the cake out of their lap, it's hilarious!  The bachelorettes had to have an orgasm off- who could make the best orgasm noise. It was pretty hilarious, and other people from the audience got involved too :) All For a free brunch!  The only down side about the place was that everything had a HUGE mark up AND there was a 7 dollar cover on top of your order.  Definitely a place for special occasions, but it might be better if you just order a single drink there, after you pre-party across the street at a cheaper bar.

Anyhow, after that we called it a night!
