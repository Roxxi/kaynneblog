Terran. Are. Awesome.

First, I have to say that in my Zerg review I mistakenly said that the nexus/hatchery/command center allow you to specify a gather rally point- apparently that's only for the Zerg :-( But no worries, the awesomeness that is the Terrans more than makes up for it.

So, I must say that, by far, my favorite changes are with respect to buildings. Now addons can be reclaimed for 100 percent of their production cost, allowing for a great way to restore money in dire times, and mitigate the opportunity cost of switching the addons that are attached to a building. On top of that, lesser buildings like bunkers and turrets can also be reclaimed for their costs. I think this was to balance with the Protoss and Zerg abilities to move their buildings (which I never figured out how to do during the demo). Additionally, Terrans could upgrade their building's armor as well as the capacity of their bunkers and the research various abilities for their buildings. Over all this gives the Terrans a feel of technology development, more than building buildings for the sake of buildings. Buildings that can also lift off much faster and travel slightly faster than before.  A number of buildings that build units can be upgraded to build 2 units at a time. Overall the Terran structures have been improved in such a way where there are real trade offs with the abilities you choose to grant them, while, at the same time you are able to quickly "re-tech" to make strategic changes on the fly. Oh, and last, but not least, supply depots can be flattened to let stuck units through, making them more versatile as wall structures for defense.

The Terran units are far more versatile that before. For the most part units are pretty dual purpose: some through form/mode switching, others through role combination. For example of the former, seige tanks still have siege mode, and one of the aerial units can convert to a ground unit; in the latter case, the drop ship also acts like a medic and is able to heal your biological units. Again, all of this makes the Terrans feel far more versatile than ever before, and lends to the potential for many interesting strategies.

Sadly, repeatedly clicking on a unit revealed no annoyance text, so no spoilers here on what they'll be saying :(  However, the update to the unit portraits and confirmations was nice an refreshing, though i really miss the firebat and medic.

What I thought was odd was the lack of units that were able to cloak. I never got to develop ghosts, and I didn't get far enough for all the air units to look at them in depth. It's really hard to get every detail in in 20 minutes while fighting off a computer :)

This is my last post re-blizzcon! Hope it was all fun!
