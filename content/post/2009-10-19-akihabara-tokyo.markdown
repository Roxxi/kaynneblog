4 hours later…

After much mind numbing reading and searching, and decision making, we decided we'd head to Fuji next, followed by Kyoto, Nara, Osaka, Hiroshima, Joyasan… and still have 3 days we wouldn't know what to do with.  But, alas, first things first- we booked our next 2 nights in Fuji, and tried to plot a course how to get there from Tokyo.  Sadly, the trip would take us almost half a day to make because of the numbers of trains and transfers we'd have to make, but, we knew that was the case going in.

After all that planning we decided we needed to go out. Sadly, Alex and Max decided to hang out in Tokyo, and we decided not to go meet them. It was great while it lasted, but we were ready to move on! Since we hadn't spent the amount of time we wanted to in Akihabara, we decided to head back for the evening.  

We started off a typical evening once again, with our fear of communication completely paralyzing us from picking a restaurant.  We once again broke down and hit up a vending machine that printed a ticket that we could take into a cook to get a meal.  Bleh. Starting to get sick of eating noodles (amazing, I know). Oh well, food accomplished, on to sights!

The first thing we did is go to the HUGE electronics store I posted pictures of last night. I tried to get pictures with Tristan and I infront of it so you could appreciate how huge this store was, and yes, they sold nothing but electronics.

We spent a good hour walking around in there, looking at all the computers, and video games, and anime toys, and appliances, and TVs. Each floor was like a single department in best buy, except with multiple items of the same brand, and multiple brands.  We spent 20 minutes looking at keyboards.  It was really amazing.

After spending our time in there, we wandered around some more, looking for anime, manga, and anime paraphernalia. Such a great street view at night…

Just wandering at random, we passed some radio stores that Tristan was interested in- saw lots of classic component stores, and eventually wandered through a series of stores in to a building that had anime gear! Oh man, another hour went by in there, with us drooling over figurines, posters, cards, art books, etc etc.  We decided before we left we'd come back and go shopping.

I, however, couldn't wait, as soon as I saw a shugo chara vending machine that spat out action figures for ¥300 a pop!  There were 5 figures, Ikuto, Amu in normal clothes, Amu in a towel with a glass of milk, Yaya, and Otau.  I figured, ok, 80% of the figures I actually want. I probably can get the Hinamori Amu figurine.  So I put in my first 300… Ikuto.  Alright… as long as it's not Yaya, I'm fine. (I hate Yaya.) Another 300… Ikuto! Damn! Oh well.. probably won't happen 3 times in a row… another 300… Yaya! Uuuuhgggghhh!!! Fail.  Grr, cmon, scraping for another 300 between Tristan and I… no whammies… Ikuto! Damn!  1200 yen, and nothing but Ikuto.  With no more coins between us, I resolve to come back another day.

We then wander into the first shop, and they're selling all of the figurines! Gaahh! I just wasted all the money for nothing. Sadly they were out of Hinamori Amu in normal clothes (hopefully I can find it when I go back), but I bought her in a towel, and Otau, nearly completing the set. I also found a Lunatic Charm Otau, and a Amulet Angel Amu, so I bought those as well! All in all, adding in the vending machine, 4200 ¥.  Ah well… my favorite anime of the moment… until I started seeing Magical Lyrical Girl Nanoha stuff! Ugggh!!!  So when I go back, I'm coming back poor! :D

After an hour of torturing ourselves looking at stuff that would easily drain our bank accounts, we forced ourselves to leave, and decided to quickly stop in Tokyo since we hadn't seen it yet at all.  Ironically Tokyo is a district in Tokyo :p. I guess they don't call Tokyo the city of endless sprawl for nothing. Right before leaving, I saw a shop that had this sign over it, and couldn't help but take a picture! Cracks me up!

Hah, 3 days in Tokyo and we finally made it to Toyko! In Tokyo, the station was just as insane as it was in Shinjuku and Akihabara- however typically when it's nuts in the station, that usually means it's not as busy up top.  In Tokyo this was more than true. It was a total ghost town.  The streets in Tokyo were huge, all of them were several lanes wide. The sidewalks, the buildings, the decortication- all of it was amazing. Super clean, super modern, super chic.  It was just so serene- and the total lack of people gave it quite the etherial like quality.  

Long story short, nothing amazing happened in Tokyo.  We didn't really find any adventure- we simply wandered the streets and enjoyed the calmness of it.  We did a lot of street photography, especially around the International Forum center, which was amazingly huge!  In fact, it made me realize how the people who write giant robot anime can conceive of structures large enough to hold these giant robots.  This building was totally immense.  I tried to take some pictures of Tristan and I just to get a feel for the scale of how big this room was.  Below is a small set of some of the street photography I took.

After all this was said and done, we went back to the hostel and both started writing about this very, very long weekend!

(I didn't actually finish this weekend stories until the second night we were in Kyoto (So I'm rather behind!)  I've been keeping notes every day about what we've been doing, so that I can write things down. Sorry for the delay.  The Ryokan we're staying at in Kyoto doesn't have internet, so I can't post these any sooner than when they'll appear!  The days to follow weren't quite as dense, so expect more frequent updates soon! <3 Alex)
